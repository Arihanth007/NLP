143.6028594970703 when used <OOV> it <OOV> the state and the economy a great deal of money

347.9184875488281 i have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in especially as the commission and parliament did not want any derogations even then

919.9912109375 seven million workers were affected and specific sectors such as the mobile worker sector have been subject to <OOV> competition over recent years especially in germany

206.943359375 it is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough mr <OOV> to use <OOV> or other technical aids

23.280607223510742 one does not <OOV> the other

294.714111328125 we also need a framework directive because the employees who are affected have been working in a <OOV> zone for a long time now

196.3256378173828 they had no rules they were not <OOV> by a collective agreement they were <OOV> and some also <OOV> in self <OOV>

137.5121612548828 we know that this <OOV> sometimes gave rise to <OOV> <OOV> problems

87.75361633300781 parliament has <OOV> sufficient flexibility mrs <OOV> <OOV> our legislative <OOV>

46.97832489013672 i think mrs <OOV> you have <OOV> that we can also <OOV>

39.52885055541992 the results are acceptable

231.96607971191406 i am trying to <OOV> support even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to

100.80760955810547 but the transition period and the <OOV> plan are the maximum we have allowed the council

375.2007141113281 i hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am <OOV> on constructive competition between the member states to see which state will be the first to implement the proposals from parliament and the commission

185.94180297851562 directive was already very <OOV> as far as worker production is concerned

91.90291595458984 it does not harmonise social legislation <OOV> quite the <OOV>

470.3067932128906 it <OOV> a european framework which <OOV> a long way short of workers <OOV> an hour <OOV> <OOV> period a hour working week a hour <OOV> <OOV>

272.73651123046875 what is more a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence

216.11190795898438 we find the compromise which parliament is to vote on today following the <OOV> of the conciliation committee <OOV> in terms of both the health and the safety of workers

331.40447998046875 it makes flexibility more <OOV> particularly for sea <OOV> establishing the systematic <OOV> of reference periods

390.3949890136719 it will permit further exemptions to the already <OOV> legislation of hours per week

288.0127868652344 finally it will take nine years in the <OOV> possible case for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from hours to

267.7811279296875 in fact the proposed working time organisation <OOV> social deregulation at the very time when in france doctors in training are <OOV> for <OOV> working conditions and <OOV> safety for <OOV> <OOV>

407.9811706542969 proper organisation of working time would <OOV> we <OOV> a real reduction in working hours <OOV> by <OOV> to create a sufficient number of jobs

35.89692306518555 we cannot support this report as it <OOV>

795.2967529296875 mr president this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in europe under the protection of the working time directive <OOV> them to have reasonable working conditions and proper <OOV> periods

384.5747375488281 however to get a hour week <OOV> doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly <OOV> years

42.62929153442383 i will not <OOV> to be happy with this situation

89.74119567871094 it is however the <OOV> that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the council s <OOV> <OOV>

241.8555450439453 it has been obvious since that those excluded from the directive at that time would <OOV> come under its protection

510.3840026855469 one has to ask therefore why over that seven year period <OOV> nothing was done in ireland or in britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it

523.6535034179688 in ireland some <OOV> doctors work over hours per week the average being to

167.09613037109375 only last <OOV> they <OOV> <OOV> action which they had <OOV> because they have now reached an <OOV> agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the <OOV> they work

400.3379211425781 in some cases they were not paid at all in some cases only half the normal rate

158.66619873046875 some progress has been made and no <OOV> the conclusion of the conciliation has <OOV> them in that regard

194.78036499023438 through the council of ministers both britain and ireland <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV> to <OOV> the process down

11.35977554321289 that was <OOV>

110.49551391601562 the working arrangements for <OOV> doctors are like a <OOV> <OOV> from a <OOV> <OOV> of the <OOV> century

109.70106506347656 i find it <OOV> that at the <OOV> of the century we are still <OOV> for common sense with regard to health and safety

494.0628356933594 i would <OOV> to all national governments including ireland not to <OOV> the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an <OOV> <OOV> if all other <OOV> <OOV> have been taken to implement the measures here

658.4683227539062 mr president the proposed working time directive for specific categories of worker such as doctors in training <OOV> workers or mobile workers is <OOV> of the <OOV> and derisory nature of social europe

191.0919952392578 the <OOV> of the proposal nonetheless <OOV> the specific importance of this <OOV> the first major <OOV> on social issues <OOV> even that it is a matter of the health and safety of million workers

256.56390380859375 in france for example a number of <OOV> by <OOV> doctors recently <OOV> the attention of public opinion to the <OOV> length of the working day for this <OOV> of worker <OOV> to the doctors in training themselves but also to the quality of the <OOV> they are providing their <OOV> with

322.57940673828125 the same question <OOV> with at least as much <OOV> for other categories such as <OOV> workers or transport workers

142.60679626464844 what we should have had was a <OOV> decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours

209.6260528564453 well the proposal does intend to cut hours but by <OOV> in the cuts

200.5870819091797 for the first three years hour working weeks are <OOV>

268.5174255371094 we have to wait years for the maximum working week to be reduced to hours and the commission is <OOV> enough to <OOV> technical reasons in order to <OOV> a further year delay in application

554.5715942382812 who are they trying to <OOV> that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the <OOV> of the workers concerned rather than <OOV> the <OOV> of management

540.1639404296875 some restriction even a derisory cut in working hours is better than no restriction at all

308.47344970703125 we shall not vote against this text but we shall <OOV> from this experience that workers can have no <OOV> of social europe and that <OOV> nothing can <OOV> the collective <OOV> of the workers when it comes to <OOV> legislation in favour of the workers

181.64059448242188 mr president the chairman of the european parliament s committee on employment and social <OOV> could not remain <OOV> in this debate

133.25035095214844 thank <OOV> my <OOV> members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself

39.824615478515625 i shall come back to this point

223.69215393066406 we are not <OOV> proud of the final result but i should at least like to pay <OOV> to it as some outcome had to be found

418.4424743652344 at this point i should like to thank mrs <OOV> our efficient and <OOV> rapporteur and mr provan who was also the <OOV> and efficient chairman of our conciliation committees

285.5969543457031 i should like to thank all our <OOV> mr <OOV> mr <OOV> mrs <OOV> mr <OOV> mrs <OOV> who <OOV> great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome

178.5721435546875 i should like to pay <OOV> to the commission without <OOV> to <OOV> you mrs <OOV> throughout almost all this debate parliament has had the technical and even political support of the commission particularly on the important amendments

426.72796630859375 i have one small <OOV> to make unless i <OOV> to what mrs <OOV> has just said it is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the european parliament and the council

242.21546936035156 it is the second following the successful conciliation on the <OOV> issue of workers working in an <OOV> <OOV>

49.550079345703125 this is however an <OOV> more <OOV> <OOV> issue of course

66.947509765625 mr president i must point out how <OOV> <OOV> the council is to deal with

194.23646545410156 the political <OOV> is that the parliament <OOV> in an <OOV> spirit of responsibility and <OOV> and you have <OOV> the <OOV> respect which i and mr <OOV> <OOV> for example have for each other was <OOV> for its united <OOV> as much as for its <OOV> to succeed

49.299869537353516 parliament made most of the running

56.26772689819336 we are not proud of the result in terms of the <OOV>

110.52497863769531 in a real democracy parliament would have been <OOV> the legislation

225.54612731933594 i would like to remind the council that we are just as <OOV> to achieving results but that they must not expect parliament to make quite so many <OOV> on a <OOV> basis

73.0353012084961 mr president i would like first of all to make three political comments

199.12588500976562 i feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure <OOV> that where there is a will there is a way

330.4537353515625 in order for this conciliation to succeed we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the member states different <OOV> of work and proposals from various <OOV> and <OOV> <OOV>

354.2935791015625 we also had to take account of the <OOV> of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries

43.40721893310547 this was no mean <OOV>

419.5459899902344 it has taken six years to achieve today s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social <OOV> and i say major because it affects some million workers

355.5044250488281 i feel that the most <OOV> point and this is my third comment is the number of workers affected by this directive who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will <OOV> these rights once this directive is applied

118.25983428955078 in my view therefore we should be satisfied <OOV> of whether or not this directive <OOV> all our requirements

677.7033081054688 the <OOV> is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training workers at sea rail workers and all <OOV> mobile workers in excluded sectors

368.2821350097656 i would like in particular to thank the chairman of the committee mr <OOV> the <OOV> chairman mr provan who used his great experience to <OOV> the conciliation procedure and of course mrs <OOV> who with her <OOV> of <OOV> experience <OOV> achieve such a difficult conciliation

518.9585571289062 i would also like to give special <OOV> to the portuguese presidency and the member states particularly those which for reasons we cannot go into right now have <OOV> major problems with their national health services such as great britain spain and ireland

89.2099838256836 certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive

55.072792053222656 i should like to <OOV> that it is indeed a particularly important issue

191.7777862548828 one of the commission s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives

187.33868408203125 here i should like to ask the meps to <OOV> with us and <OOV> monitor any <OOV> plans in member states so that the commission can <OOV> immediately

193.9991455078125 a further two questions have also been raised the first by <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV> as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors

115.58425903320312 first i must tell you that the transport council is involved making the whole process even more <OOV>

67.79429626464844 secondly as for road transport the commission tabled a proposal in but it was <OOV> by the council in

101.578857421875 the commission intends with the cooperation of the french presidency to <OOV> table the issue

248.6281280517578 we are <OOV> new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their <OOV>

147.0187530517578 if we cannot <OOV> in this way we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far

119.6206283569336 with regard to the issue of fisheries the matter was raised once again by mr <OOV>

30.990367889404297 we have discussed this in the past

52.8485107421875 i will try to clarify it

42.79413604736328 i am <OOV> i was not clear enough

121.03772735595703 so i would like to <OOV> that the issue of self employment in fisheries is not included in this directive

192.49716186523438 the self employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence

28.35004425048828 that is very clear and very <OOV>

122.04821014404297 i thank you very much for all your support and help during these <OOV> and that of your services

32.07856750488281 it is very much <OOV> indeed

20.298181533813477 the debate is closed

73.64190673828125 the vote will take place tomorrow at a m

38.10865020751953 reviewing aid to third

130.38815307617188 the next item is the commission <OOV> reviewing aid to third countries

419.10687255859375 mr president i hope parliament will <OOV> me if shortly after making a brief <OOV> i have to leave but this is as parliament knows very much the collective work of the <OOV> commissioners as a whole and very much the <OOV> work of my colleague commissioner nielson and <OOV>

317.6842346191406 commissioner nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise

325.4801330566406 the <OOV> i have to <OOV> is a joint <OOV> of two committees which was <OOV> <OOV> to <OOV> a number of external assistance issues so i hope parliament will be understanding

398.7980041503906 i think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the <OOV> of the issues that are raised in the white paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to <OOV> that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the <OOV> or one of the <OOV> for an overall reform process

733.3748168945312 people <OOV> get a little <OOV> when one <OOV> about internal procedures but what they should <OOV> is what we are discussing in these particular proposals ways in which first of all we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and secondly ways in which we can change the <OOV> of the european union around the world

381.18310546875 all of us have <OOV> <OOV> too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the <OOV> for what we are trying to do on behalf of europe s <OOV> we get <OOV> for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly

98.64568328857422 i hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle

124.71678924560547 very briefly it is worth <OOV> ourselves what the background to this issue is

357.2193908691406 we have seen a <OOV> increase in external assistance commitments managed by the <OOV> over the last years

166.58335876464844 that has been <OOV> by <OOV> and by political <OOV> a <OOV> of the responsibilities we should <OOV> in central and eastern europe the <OOV> which that <OOV> of our responsibilities in the mediterranean

370.4458312988281 it is worth <OOV> that our assistance programmes in the mediterranean have increased four and a half times since

166.4041290283203 then there is the <OOV> crisis where the attempts to put in place a common <OOV> and <OOV> policy are being particularly <OOV>

750.5557861328125 while our external assistance programmes themselves have <OOV> very rapidly staff resources have failed to keep <OOV>

375.6735534667969 the commission has staff for every eur million that we manage

343.37860107421875 that <OOV> with an average figure about <OOV> that for member states the figure is but it <OOV> as high as for some member states and for the world bank

223.88343811035156 one of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance <OOV> which has been much <OOV> by parliament and by the <OOV> of <OOV> on the grounds of <OOV> monitoring and a lack of political control

227.41085815429688 it is worth <OOV> that we have <OOV> about eur million a year on the technical assistance <OOV> which is <OOV> to the <OOV> of staff working for the commission

199.69041442871094 a consequence of all this is that the <OOV> today has over eur billion in <OOV> commitments <OOV> <OOV>

63.306819915771484 that is an <OOV> large figure

161.59756469726562 i do not <OOV> the staff of the <OOV> who work extremely hard in very difficult <OOV> but there are not enough of them

155.83779907226562 they have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures

356.0466003417969 they have also had to operate against a background of member states second third and <OOV> <OOV> every implementation decision that we try to make

253.95443725585938 we have brought forward in the document which has now been made public our proposals for <OOV> with this problem

364.61700439453125 as honourable members will know over the years parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should <OOV> the management of our <OOV> aid

323.67633056640625 that remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework

477.92291259765625 however my <OOV> concern at the moment is not how we get from a to <OOV> that often seems rather <OOV> than getting from a to <OOV> what we have to do whatever the long term objective may be is to find better ways of <OOV> our external assistance <OOV>

521.5641479492188 we have put forward a number of proposals we have put forward proposals for improving <OOV> making sure that all the <OOV> commissioners share responsibility for <OOV> we have suggested the <OOV> of the project cycle from <OOV> to implementation we think the present <OOV> has not worked well

306.2366943359375 what we propose to do is to create a new implementation body <OOV> the <OOV> which we think should be called europe aid

310.90423583984375 it would be <OOV> an office under a board made up of all the external relations commissioners though as i say the <OOV> of <OOV> to <OOV> in the longer term remains on the table

126.39425659179688 we want to <OOV> more responsibility to <OOV> and where possible to national authorities in the field

1299.6883544921875 we have proposed special treatment for the <OOV> accession strategy humanitarian assistance and <OOV> financial assistance with <OOV> <OOV> management

105.51728820800781 that means for example <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> for <OOV> to the <OOV> general for enlargement

340.9089050292969 we have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the <OOV> of old and <OOV> projects

93.70169067382812 we are writing to the relevant <OOV> of <OOV> committees and to the <OOV> of <OOV> to <OOV> our approach

472.2979431152344 i do not want to go on for very much longer <OOV> to say this where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office europe aid rather better in the future than we have managed in the past

293.26068115234375 we have to take our turn with others in the commission in <OOV> our <OOV> in the <OOV> group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively

259.12725830078125 we may as a result present the budgetary authority with a <OOV> letter to the budget proposals in <OOV>

18.124652862548828 that is for the future

92.0361328125 the simple point i want to make is this we cannot go on as we have

37.451515197753906 in my <OOV> it is simply not an <OOV>

24.218486785888672 we have to do better

22.732580184936523 we are not <OOV> for a <OOV> <OOV>

461.2195739746094 the budgetary authority will <OOV> have to judge the right scale of european union external aid programmes

225.10028076171875 however my only aim is to put the commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently

597.8506469726562 i have to say very <OOV> to parliament that there are two <OOV> either the budgetary authority <OOV> with our <OOV> and will then try to implement them from or else in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently we will be obliged to propose very large cuts

602.2958374023438 we cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is <OOV> by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes

550.2662353515625 we have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be <OOV> our help to enable them to read and <OOV> or <OOV> a better and <OOV> <OOV> or create the institutions of good <OOV> in their <OOV>

99.68304443359375 they are the people who suffer as well as the european union s <OOV>

56.10310745239258 i am sure this will be a long debate

246.32542419433594 i am sure that parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months

386.06463623046875 however my impression after a few months in this job is that parliament <OOV> as <OOV> as the commission to <OOV> a more competently run assistance programme all around the world

91.6269302368164 mr president this is <OOV> the fact that the european union is <OOV> that there are problems but that we have solutions

157.24087524414062 commissioner nielson will <OOV> that a <OOV> of months ago i suggested that it might be the case that he could become an <OOV> without <OOV>

558.077880859375 is it not the case now that this proposal taking away so much from dg development as it does is likely to make my <OOV> come true

525.2933349609375 secondly at the end of what commissioner patten was saying i think he <OOV> what he was <OOV> as saying in the times this <OOV> where he said that member states should back his plans with resources or cut aid

186.74501037597656 i have to say commissioners that i find this a <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV> <OOV> and likely to be taken at its face value by member states and not in the way that you <OOV>

96.73725128173828 i would very much <OOV> <OOV> of those two questions by one or other commissioner

176.67556762695312 mr president i do not feel like an <OOV> without <OOV> but you can judge for yourself

182.15452575683594 the situation is that we had to do something not just to <OOV> the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities

207.12783813476562 we also had to do something concerning <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> giving <OOV> to my political overall responsibility for development policy

141.1539764404297 we have done this without changing the <OOV> that were defined

241.013916015625 the solution we have reached is to create a board of <OOV> which will <OOV> and <OOV> be the <OOV> part of running the new office or <OOV> or whatever <OOV> is going to be called

57.31108474731445 my role on that board will be that of the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV>

175.69129943847656 commissioner patten will be chairman <OOV> the position he already has at the <OOV> of the table being the <OOV> <OOV> of all <OOV> commissioners activities

144.8199920654297 we are in a sense <OOV> the political <OOV> that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that i think it really does have a <OOV> of <OOV>

172.11769104003906 there are two elements in this which will <OOV> to better <OOV> and better political consistency

118.13777160644531 one is what i have already mentioned with a <OOV> political <OOV> in the management of the <OOV> implementation

160.2103271484375 the other one is the quality support group which will have its <OOV> in dg development

171.45223999023438 the role is to make sure that the <OOV> of the different programmes including those in dg <OOV> is <OOV> with the policy and principles that we have defined

305.1544189453125 all in all i think this is a good <OOV> at doing things given the way things were defined last <OOV>

146.65274047851562 this will also <OOV> a lot of attention among all <OOV> commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are <OOV>

46.66471862792969 we have to get out of the <OOV> of commitment and into the <OOV> of <OOV>

71.42173767089844 what we are doing here will be part of that change

122.14503479003906 we also talk about <OOV> in our <OOV> countries as being a major problem

134.37013244628906 the reality because of the way we are <OOV> in the commission is that <OOV> on our side is extremely <OOV> and problematic

113.75830841064453 this is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are <OOV> forward now

222.35890197753906 finally i will <OOV> the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job

133.99217224121094 clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable it is not possible

307.8332214355469 we have to make the point as clearly as commissioner patten just did which means that we want those resources

131.00306701660156 we have commitments we have an agreement with <OOV> states we have the member states <OOV> that and <OOV> the next <OOV> european development <OOV>

252.76596069335938 all this is part of the promises we have made already so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job

302.1663818359375 but how to do it this is a problem we cannot solve <OOV> which is why we are <OOV> as <OOV> and clearly as we are and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff we will not be able to do the job

32.823429107666016 this is the situation as we see it

106.4498062133789 we do not want to <OOV> our own role as commissioners in <OOV> a <OOV> <OOV>

55.277435302734375 we want to <OOV> a <OOV> we can be proud of <OOV> in

347.1798400878906 mr president i am very happy to hear that in order to <OOV> commitments more resources and personnel are required

143.7676239013672 as parliament is aware of this we will offer our full support

207.46682739257812 however i would like to ask a question since i have not had time to study the document at length

90.45477294921875 what will <OOV> to humanitarian aid

661.22705078125 we understand that the union s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it but it has to continue we talk in this context of a <OOV> so that development policies can be carried out

457.08367919921875 otherwise we may see a <OOV> of what is <OOV> in <OOV> at the moment clearly humanitarian aid was <OOV> echo <OOV> development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore <OOV> may <OOV> once again

262.45489501953125 within this <OOV> i would like to know whether as has been the case until now echo will be an office <OOV> on the commission but whose action will be based on development policies <OOV> at what we want to see and that is the <OOV> of <OOV>

79.32994842529297 mr president it is a <OOV> that mr patten had to leave so <OOV>

92.65254974365234 i actually wanted to put my question to him

389.97216796875 but i think that mr nielson is <OOV> well <OOV> to answer me because he has been <OOV> by his colleague s side and he also said that both commissioners were responsible for the proposal

221.96224975585938 mr nielson of course we here in parliament share your aim of providing <OOV> aid to <OOV> and <OOV> and <OOV> the <OOV> of the european union

27.9148006439209 that <OOV> without saying

232.35496520996094 but we had all agreed that what the commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us

171.91085815429688 when mr patten <OOV> in his <OOV> that either the commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts i find that highly <OOV>

310.00482177734375 it is we who are the budgetary authority or at least part of it and i think that the commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts

292.13995361328125 that if you please has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us

187.7259979248047 i should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat

100.9012680053711 mr president i am very <OOV> that commissioner patten had to leave

330.53753662109375 in his <OOV> i am delighted to direct my questions to the development commissioner mr nielson

122.12598419189453 i am delighted to hear of new <OOV> and <OOV> which the commission is going to put into place

170.852294921875 <OOV> would be a very important <OOV> of the european union as far as our external relations are concerned

119.11385345458984 it has been extremely <OOV> so far that some of our promises have not been <OOV>

229.69009399414062 not <OOV> promises to the <OOV> people in the world is not the <OOV> way to go about as a <OOV> part of the world trying to help them

318.379150390625 <OOV> the <OOV> commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my <OOV> support

419.8943176269531 i am also delighted to hear that they are <OOV> to create a board very much like the world bank

337.7364807128906 but i should like to ask commissioner nielson if he has <OOV> about something which is very important to this side of the house the <OOV> in the world bank has the <OOV> to help in the private sector with funding

140.7462921142578 <OOV> <OOV> and various other <OOV> are key to helping people to help themselves

277.1994323730469 have they considered extending in <OOV> some <OOV> of helping people to help themselves through an investment <OOV> where the european union <OOV> a <OOV> in <OOV> and <OOV>

262.5534973144531 firstly echo is not affected by this reform of development assistance

59.237308502197266 echo is going to continue

42.16227722167969 this is clearly part of what we have <OOV>

554.1434326171875 the only issue is to create a better link or <OOV> between the <OOV> of humanitarian assistance and the more forward <OOV> long term development assistance

67.45092010498047 this is a well established discussion

173.33941650390625 we want to keep echo more or less the way it is

99.09736633300781 i have <OOV> that with the new <OOV> of echo we are on track

476.63995361328125 to mrs <OOV> i should like to make it clear that commissioner patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue

187.3332977294922 why are we saying this as clearly as we are even running the risk of being <OOV> as if <OOV> a threat

23.099206924438477 i <OOV> your <OOV> of <OOV> there

224.74954223632812 we think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the <OOV> that we need

147.77590942382812 it is not possible to do this well without being more or less <OOV> like other well <OOV> <OOV>

10.572098731994629 this is the <OOV>

90.15523529052734 it may very well be the case that we are being <OOV> in this parliament because on this matter we are <OOV> among <OOV>

70.15865325927734 so saying it as clearly as we do here may <OOV> <OOV>

9.553007125854492 i <OOV> that

125.65867614746094 but there are other elements around

25.13800621032715 we have to say it <OOV> <OOV> <OOV>

114.35943603515625 it is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear

545.5291748046875 i do not mean to be <OOV> about ministers of <OOV> but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion

49.45478820800781 development ministers are not that <OOV> either

370.671630859375 the biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of <OOV> defined in this field and the resources and <OOV> that we have available to carry out the job

60.72325897216797 this is our biggest problem

237.0645294189453 we will be making a positive <OOV> to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now

132.58433532714844 i should like to add that though it is right to point out the <OOV> the problems and the <OOV> it should not be <OOV> that we are <OOV> <OOV> out there <OOV> of <OOV> in length we are <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> for <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> giving <OOV> of people access to <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> every year

83.16265869140625 we are <OOV> in people in <OOV> education in a large number of countries

173.54884338378906 we are making a contribution to the <OOV> <OOV> second to <OOV> even <OOV> ourselves with the biggest countries in the world

99.2516098022461 we would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned

208.79287719726562 i <OOV> against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but <OOV>

16.493793487548828 that is not the case

184.1966552734375 we have to be realistic clear and demanding in order to enter the <OOV> <OOV> amongst <OOV> and not to remain where we are right now

29.20965003967285 this is the goal

382.33270263671875 mr <OOV> we will as part of the new <OOV> agreement the <OOV> to the <OOV> <OOV> be including in our activities a eur billion private investment <OOV> which will be <OOV> by the european investment bank at <OOV> s length

427.08868408203125 it will deal with private partners <OOV> and helping the creation of business activities between european companies and business in the developing <OOV> countries

177.2008056640625 this major <OOV> is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about

154.1064910888672 <OOV> <OOV> is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems

85.57164001464844 however we are quite active in this field also

95.80104064941406 i thank parliament for what i sense to be a more than positive <OOV> because the <OOV> <OOV> that i have <OOV> are of a kind that i would <OOV> to <OOV> as <OOV> support

252.53375244140625 we should be <OOV> not to end up <OOV> a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our <OOV> lower

111.15702819824219 thank you very much mr nielson for your <OOV> view of the future

13.420888900756836 question time commission

53.7150764465332 the next item is question time we will <OOV> questions to the commission

5.903934478759766 first

37.93651580810547 question no by h

319.9525146484375 subject <OOV> of <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in china is the commission aware of the recent trial involving <OOV> <OOV> in china and the <OOV> prison sentence that was imposed

29.622407913208008 what action did the commission take

298.4323425292969 the commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable member in his question and of the sentence imposed on mr <OOV> who <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in <OOV> up a <OOV> of the <OOV> china democracy party

117.87906646728516 <OOV> <OOV> one of the <OOV> of the <OOV> was <OOV> to years in <OOV> in december along with two other <OOV> democracy <OOV>

353.53118896484375 as the honourable member will know the <OOV> policy of the union is to <OOV> the individual cases of chinese <OOV> who have been in prison for political <OOV> with the chinese authorities particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue the last <OOV> of which <OOV> place on february this year

662.083984375 the union has therefore raised with the chinese government the cases of <OOV> <OOV> and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are <OOV> by the united <OOV> s <OOV> on <OOV> and political rights which was actually <OOV> by china in <OOV>

341.50048828125 to date the commission knows that at least <OOV> members have been <OOV> for <OOV> as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which china is <OOV>

392.6518249511719 in relation to these and other cases the commission <OOV> calls upon the people s republic of china to comply with the letter and spirit of the united <OOV> s human rights <OOV> which it has <OOV> to do so even before china s <OOV> of those <OOV> and <OOV> to <OOV> <OOV>

79.68241882324219 these efforts by the commission will continue

272.4236145019531 i thank you commissioner for your answer and i should like to ask whether the commission is aware that months into his year prison sentence mr <OOV> is <OOV> from <OOV> and there are serious doubts as to the <OOV> of the <OOV> treatment he is <OOV>

279.0453186035156 i would seek an <OOV> that the commission will <OOV> into this and ask the chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate <OOV> treatment

139.29762268066406 <OOV> in mind commissioner what you said about your <OOV> to <OOV> individual cases could i also ask you to make <OOV> about the <OOV> of <OOV> <OOV>

133.16790771484375 she was <OOV> on <OOV> in <OOV> the <OOV> of the <OOV> while on her way to meet representatives of the us <OOV> research <OOV>

235.05029296875 she was <OOV> with providing secret information to <OOV> and is <OOV> to have been <OOV> to <OOV> years <OOV> at a secret trial

63.7592658996582 i will <OOV> provide more <OOV> information on that mr commissioner

305.9389953613281 it makes me even more <OOV> that european union member states <OOV> with these cases and the in general you referred to <OOV> such <OOV> in <OOV> to support the us <OOV> in <OOV> at the <OOV> commission on human rights <OOV> china s human rights <OOV>

286.2504577636719 i should like to tell the honourable member that in respect to mr <OOV> i will <OOV> what he said about the apparently <OOV> <OOV> of that political <OOV> to my colleagues in the external relations area

320.4921875 i am certain that they will follow previous practice in making <OOV> of the chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of mr <OOV> for <OOV>

383.3032531738281 i know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable member in order to keep him <OOV> with any information they are able to obtain

140.7572021484375 so far as <OOV> <OOV> is concerned obviously i did not have <OOV> of that question and am not in a position to respond

32.3175048828125 the question will however have been <OOV>

203.4873504638672 i will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable member with the response he is <OOV>

239.91064453125 obviously it would be a matter of great concern if <OOV> whose only <OOV> is to be <OOV> towards an existing <OOV> were to be the <OOV> of <OOV> treatment

249.51922607421875 i know that my colleagues <OOV> in the commission share this view which i share with the honourable member

37.93651580810547 question no by h

186.8207550048828 subject the commission s reform programme and enlargement on march the commission adopted the white paper on the reform of the commission

317.61322021484375 the measures and actions <OOV> in the white paper provide for a <OOV> reform of the commission which will <OOV> a considerable amount of time

319.3797607421875 can the commission <OOV> to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement

416.16802978515625 do they <OOV> the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences

301.85821533203125 if so in what way if not would it not have been more logical for the commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects <OOV> <OOV> a situation <OOV> shortly after <OOV> of the current reform process the commission has to enter into a <OOV> <OOV> of reforms to <OOV> with the impact of enlargement

237.37913513183594 does the commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable as is the case with the present reform plan in order to prepare the structure of the commission for the forthcoming enlargement

359.38323974609375 the commission s reform strategy white paper <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> given to parliament and to the council last year to give immediate attention to <OOV> the way in which the institution as an organisation currently <OOV> its duties

135.7290496826172 delay in <OOV> a <OOV> strategy and in <OOV> necessary <OOV> would not have been acceptable to the commission to the council to this parliament or to the public as i am sure the honourable member <OOV>

349.2457580566406 one of the specifically stated <OOV> of <OOV> reform is the development of <OOV> administrative <OOV> which will amongst other things enable the commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future union and in the <OOV> world

639.9337768554688 clearly the challenges <OOV> by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those <OOV> by any previous enlargement

139.78567504882812 the commission must therefore be <OOV> of achieving the <OOV> standards of <OOV> and administrative <OOV> in the <OOV> of its <OOV> and duties in order to <OOV> that <OOV> and welcome development

567.57666015625 as the <OOV> of commissioners made clear in our introduction to the white paper and <OOV> in that document and i <OOV> what we said the challenges of <OOV> and future enlargement require better <OOV> at all levels including the european union

67.26790618896484 all political institutions must rise to this <OOV> and so must the commission

75.07196807861328 reform is therefore an essential <OOV> a <OOV> for <OOV> our <OOV> of europe

249.5102996826172 the current administrative reform is not a <OOV> exercise it is an <OOV> process as we have made very clear it will be <OOV> <OOV> and the results achieved will be <OOV> in order to provide for any relevant <OOV>

351.3125915527344 proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process and naturally that will apply to human resources <OOV> of the <OOV> change

244.00335693359375 issues such as the management of the increased <OOV> <OOV> within the commission and an <OOV> <OOV> scheme that is <OOV> <OOV> to enlargement will for <OOV> be amongst those that receive particular attention

201.96102905273438 as with past <OOV> specific measures concerning the <OOV> and integration of <OOV> from the new member states will be adopted at the appropriate time

49.22254180908203 i would like to thank the commissioner for his response

44.10816955566406 i would however like to add something

261.69342041015625 one of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to <OOV> the veterinary and plant health conditions <OOV> in the <OOV> countries to those in the european union

729.6878051757812 would the commissioner be prepared to <OOV> <OOV> from the central and eastern european countries that wish to <OOV> the eu to <OOV> management committees scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health on a permanent basis

347.0731506347656 mr president the honourable member s approach to these and many other matters is i know extremely constructive

365.85687255859375 what i know on the basis of <OOV> and also the commission s assessment of the scope and the <OOV> of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the <OOV> and integration of <OOV> <OOV> staff from the new member states but also to <OOV> with the <OOV> of other areas of <OOV> <OOV> including the scientific and other committees

141.97999572753906 to some extent of course the process will be <OOV> by the fact that the international <OOV> community <OOV> and outside the european union is <OOV> international

465.6465148925781 in <OOV> to <OOV> upon those <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> i am sure that the commission will want to ensure that there is <OOV> and access provided for those new <OOV> member states not only in areas like those that he has mentioned veterinary and plant health but in many other areas where the <OOV> possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance

37.93651580810547 question no by h

710.8494873046875 subject <OOV> of community <OOV> by canadian inspectors in international waters five years after the <OOV> of the <OOV> the community fleet fishing in <OOV> international waters has <OOV> deep concern at the <OOV> of a portuguese vessel the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> by canadian inspectors

163.57200622558594 the <OOV> <OOV> a vessel used to <OOV> <OOV> was <OOV> on <OOV> last the inspectors <OOV> all <OOV> and <OOV> to leave the vessel

272.9051818847656 furthermore a <OOV> <OOV> to the canadian authorities has been <OOV> the vessel constantly <OOV> <OOV> its fishing activity

549.5670166015625 a few <OOV> earlier canadian inspectors had apparently <OOV> a spanish <OOV> <OOV> which was also fishing in international waters

121.97315979003906 european <OOV> <OOV> that the <OOV> aim of these <OOV> <OOV> is to <OOV> them from using the fishing grounds in which they <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV>

37.32733154296875 what information does the commission <OOV> on these <OOV>

218.89572143554688 can it clarify whether the inspectors were <OOV> on behalf of <OOV> or the canadian government

118.18209075927734 has it taken any action in this regard or does it intend to do so

539.99365234375 should <OOV> community monitoring rules for inspections in <OOV> waters <OOV> problematic for <OOV> what initiatives could the commission take to set clear and <OOV> rules which would <OOV> the doubts of those working in the sector and the canadian government alike

16.15467071533203 thank you mr president

1142.5943603515625 as the honourable member who raised the question will know in accordance with the <OOV> <OOV> fisheries organisation scheme of joint international inspection and <OOV> each contracting party may <OOV> means of inspection and inspectors to the <OOV> scheme and <OOV> inspectors may <OOV> any fishing vessel <OOV> the <OOV> of a contracting party

1103.029052734375 <OOV> inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the <OOV> scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them

547.0136108398438 against that background on <OOV> two canadian <OOV> inspectors <OOV> by a <OOV> carried out an inspection of the community fishing vessel <OOV> <OOV> which was operating at that time in the <OOV> <OOV> area

336.32354736328125 the canadian inspectors in question and the <OOV> vessel from which the inspection was carried out are <OOV> to the <OOV> scheme

138.58370971679688 their inspection was carried out under its <OOV>

170.87255859375 having been <OOV> by the <OOV> inspectors of the commission <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> to <OOV> the grounds on which the canadian inspectors based their <OOV> of a serious <OOV>

126.68777465820312 in <OOV> this <OOV> the commission inspectors <OOV> the <OOV> and <OOV> of the <OOV> on board and <OOV> their report to the portuguese authorities

123.2781982421875 those authorities in turn <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> to the <OOV> of <OOV> in <OOV> for a thorough inspection

201.2945098876953 the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in <OOV> on may and two commission inspectors <OOV> in a thorough inspection of the vessel

352.9980773925781 the commission has drawn the attention of the canadian authorities to the procedures <OOV> by the canadian inspectors in relation to their <OOV> of <OOV> and their <OOV> stay on board the <OOV> <OOV>

844.94287109375 the commission takes the view that the canadian <OOV> inspectors in question <OOV> in breach of the <OOV> scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the <OOV> of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel

364.178955078125 however it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the portuguese authorities did not <OOV> the <OOV> stay of the canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the <OOV> <OOV> were not <OOV>

304.0091857910156 mr commissioner i am satisfied with your reply but i would like to add something else

458.3084411621094 the sea is a difficult world and the community fleet which <OOV> in international <OOV> waters experiences the <OOV> of <OOV> and <OOV> from <OOV> countries which give the impression that <OOV> the <OOV> they sometimes suffer there is one <OOV> intention to <OOV> them from those fishing grounds

116.93915557861328 the commissioner knows as i do that the current situation in the <OOV> is not <OOV> what it was five years ago after the <OOV> of the <OOV>

407.2422790527344 the european commission like the fishing sector itself has made significant efforts to <OOV> out our differences

725.8900756835938 however there are still <OOV> questions such as the <OOV> <OOV> which allow the canadian government to carry out inspections <OOV> and <OOV> beyond their national waters in open sea which is incompatible with international provisions and which all too frequently <OOV> the <OOV> application of <OOV> within the framework of the <OOV>

278.3097839355469 for all these reasons i would like to ask the commissioner how the european commission intends to <OOV> the right of the community fleet to <OOV> <OOV> in these waters albeit within the existing rules

61.29276657104492 mr president i am grateful to the honourable <OOV>

453.8033142089844 the only way in which we can actually ensure the proper <OOV> of an international <OOV> which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are <OOV> <OOV> in a <OOV> but a completely full way

506.1745910644531 that is the position being taken by the commission which is why i <OOV> attention to the fact that the commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the canadian inspectors actually <OOV> in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the <OOV> of the master and by <OOV> <OOV> of their very <OOV> stay on board that vessel

421.5142822265625 the portuguese authorities as the honourable <OOV> will know because of her interest are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the commission to <OOV> <OOV> beyond those i have already <OOV> but she can be absolutely certain that the commission and its inspectors together with the member states are <OOV> in <OOV> the proper rights of all <OOV> on the high <OOV>

265.91943359375 mr president i had asked the question as a result of mr kinnock s first reply before mrs <OOV> asked her question

201.1995849609375 i had <OOV> from mr kinnock that the <OOV> was in fact being <OOV> in a portuguese <OOV> and that this inspection had taken place in the <OOV> of community inspectors

215.1278839111328 i understand from his second reply that he does not yet have the result of that inspection

82.37812042236328 that is what i wanted him to clarify

197.6813201904297 if he does have it i would like him to say so but i understand from his second reply that he does not

71.53234100341797 if that is the case i believe it would be <OOV> and logical for us to <OOV> the final result

162.8249053955078 i would ask mr kinnock to <OOV> to mr <OOV> that as chairman of the committee on fisheries i would like to know the result of that inspection as <OOV> as possible

110.45028686523438 i would like to receive it because this parliament will have to act <OOV>

209.52113342285156 in any event i would like to <OOV> in support of mrs <OOV> the <OOV> of authority on the part of the canadian <OOV> inspectors which mr kinnock mentioned

50.425315856933594 i would therefore like to make that request and <OOV> this <OOV> of <OOV> regulations

156.7659912109375 mr president i will draw the honourable member s <OOV> to the attention of my colleague mr <OOV> and i know that they will be of interest to him

191.0607452392578 he <OOV> the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the portuguese authorities are <OOV> their <OOV>

401.4881286621094 it would not be proper <OOV> to <OOV> the matter further but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the portuguese authorities are available i am certain that they will be <OOV> to interested members including of course the chairman of parliament s committee on fisheries and i am certain the honourable <OOV> whose interest is <OOV>

37.93651580810547 question no by h

290.93487548828125 subject need to support and <OOV> the <OOV> oil sector the implementation of the new <OOV> oil regulation is having <OOV> consequences for <OOV> producers who are <OOV> <OOV> in <OOV> and <OOV> regions

657.9186401367188 the <OOV> of the intervention price which had already been <OOV> has brought producer prices down to derisory levels together with the <OOV> responsibility <OOV> this has had the effect of <OOV> <OOV> oil producers <OOV>

621.8471069335938 the <OOV> of <OOV> who <OOV> <OOV> oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers price have increased and the small quota <OOV> to greece in practice <OOV> out the <OOV> to plant a further <OOV> provided for in the new regulation

657.8526000976562 since <OOV> oil is a basic product and the main <OOV> of <OOV> for <OOV> from the most disadvantaged regions in greece and is also a <OOV> of the mediterranean <OOV> will the commission say what measures it intends to take to <OOV> <OOV> oil <OOV> and producers <OOV> so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act

313.7743225097656 does it intend to increase the quota in order to <OOV> existing production and the <OOV> of production expected to result from the new <OOV>

123.79733276367188 will it <OOV> the institution of intervention but <OOV> as far as prices and the date of <OOV> are concerned

298.9957275390625 finally will it draw up and implement an <OOV> and <OOV> policy to promote and <OOV> <OOV> oil both in the eu countries and in third countries so that <OOV> oil can <OOV> the place to which it is entitled according to scientific <OOV> in the human <OOV>

6.043703556060791 second

11.100179672241211 questions to mr

437.05841064453125 one of the <OOV> benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it <OOV> me with <OOV> <OOV> on issues as far <OOV> as fishing <OOV> oil and human rights in china

60.440216064453125 i am happy to respond to mr <OOV>

87.0660629272461 in <OOV> the commission <OOV> to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in <OOV> oil to the council and parliament in

153.6502227783203 the new <OOV> would apply from the marketing year which as the honourable member will know <OOV> on <OOV>

703.2147216796875 the commission is currently <OOV> new data on the structure of <OOV> oil production in the various producer member states as well as developments in the world market where the community is the leading producer by a considerable <OOV>

435.259521484375 the study will also take into account the need to draw up an <OOV> oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product

387.42913818359375 as far as product promotion is concerned the community is already <OOV> promotion <OOV> through the international <OOV> oil council

161.9837188720703 those <OOV> appear to have a positive effect within the european union and indeed in third countries

201.7699737548828 in response to a specific issue raised by the honourable member s question i have to point out that the <OOV> of new <OOV> would not give <OOV> to aid

344.9022521972656 however the commission <OOV> that the community producers concerned will benefit <OOV> under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved <OOV> programmes although the <OOV> oil in question would <OOV> towards the maximum <OOV> <OOV> which has already been set

749.6148071289062 finally the commission wishes to point out that rather than simply <OOV> the intervention system what has actually happened is that it has been <OOV> by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support

352.29608154296875 since the start of the marketing year it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid

158.15576171875 however it is worth <OOV> that over that same period the old <OOV> in intervention system would not have been <OOV> either

193.6900634765625 mr president we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this <OOV>

521.5482788085938 because of the policies of the european union <OOV> oil producers are <OOV> at the <OOV> of big producers who <OOV> among themselves and try to <OOV> <OOV> oil at <OOV> low prices

206.9389190673828 this situation has reached <OOV> <OOV> with the <OOV> of the albeit <OOV> intervention system and the system of private storage let me <OOV> you is quite <OOV> a <OOV>

42.891693115234375 so how are we to deal with this situation

203.92031860351562 will an <OOV> intervention system providing <OOV> protection for producers be <OOV>

281.36590576171875 and given that on a <OOV> scale <OOV> oil is so important to the human body and <OOV> such an important role in <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in disadvantaged areas why is it that the <OOV> particularly for greece are so low

42.825870513916016 are you going to increase them

304.6519775390625 and with the <OOV> practice of <OOV> <OOV> oil with <OOV> <OOV> oil what does the commission intend to do to put a <OOV> to this practice which is <OOV> producers and <OOV> to the benefit of industrial <OOV>

327.70501708984375 in this spirit does the commission believe that this <OOV> can be <OOV> through <OOV> i e by increasing the quota for <OOV> which is the main country responsible for <OOV> oil and reducing the quota for greece

226.2938995361328 i am grateful to the honourable member and i know of the deep concerns he <OOV> they certainly are <OOV> in this house and he does it in a most <OOV> <OOV>

229.62474060058594 all i can say to him at this <OOV> because i know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him is that the <OOV> for <OOV> oil is due to be <OOV> as i indicated earlier by <OOV> following agreement in the council and in this parliament in <OOV> regulation

280.534912109375 i cannot <OOV> that if the situation were precisely as the honourable member <OOV> and <OOV> producers were in a <OOV> disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers there would have been such agreement in the council and in this house

487.1260986328125 therefore i hope he will give attention to the results of the studies i mentioned being <OOV> at the moment by the commission both in terms of the general questions he raised when he <OOV> his question and also in terms of the <OOV> <OOV> of big producers and small producers

293.9609375 finally as <OOV> who is merely a consumer of <OOV> oil i hope there is no extensive <OOV> of what is one of my <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> and that whatever else we do in the european community we <OOV> together with <OOV> oil producers of all <OOV> to <OOV> the maximum quality

384.4526672363281 that is how we <OOV> our considerable lead in world markets

148.35824584960938 thank you very much mr kinnock for your cooperation during this question time

123.85233306884766 we also congratulate you for using <OOV> oil which is very good for the health

59.38917922973633 i also say this from a mediterranean <OOV>

37.93651580810547 question no by h

1321.939208984375 subject further integration <OOV> by emu in the commission s <OOV> to what extent do the requirements imposed by emu on economic policy which include <OOV> <OOV> exchange rates create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget a common <OOV> policy <OOV> transfers between member states increased labour mobility between the <OOV> states and or a more flexible labour market

797.8939208984375 the introduction of the euro will increase economic integration and <OOV> the positive effects of the single market primarily by <OOV> the <OOV> relating to exchange rates

978.9541015625 there are also other <OOV> there is greater <OOV> in prices an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union

1036.4442138671875 at the same time as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all member states of the monetary union it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets

93.26611328125 this should also bring benefits for <OOV> and <OOV>

371.75775146484375 for this to have the <OOV> positive effect it is essential that we carry out a policy of <OOV> public <OOV> which will not <OOV> <OOV> in monetary policy itself and at the same time a <OOV> policy of <OOV> reforms and a competition policy which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process

432.8835754394531 in order for economic and monetary union to <OOV> <OOV> we do not need a major budget which will allow <OOV> transfers in the event of difficulties

544.10009765625 i believe that the treaty <OOV> by the stability and growth pact provides <OOV> instruments to implement an economic policy which is <OOV> with a <OOV> monetary policy

1015.797607421875 the basic framework which we have <OOV> is a framework of mutual <OOV> of national <OOV> policies and of <OOV> of economic policies by means of processes to improve our <OOV> situations and the <OOV> or creation of a positive <OOV> environment which will favour growth and employment and at the same time reduce the possibility of <OOV> <OOV> caused by economic policies

351.0420837402344 budgetary consolidation itself which is of course the reduction of the public <OOV> gives each member state room to act in <OOV> situations

378.13983154296875 greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of <OOV> <OOV>

553.993896484375 both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in <OOV> would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment

101.32371520996094 that is why we <OOV> particular importance to labour mobility

215.91029357910156 the commission has therefore <OOV> on its various <OOV> regarding the specific point of labour mobility while <OOV> aware that this is a difficult issue

285.40277099609375 it is difficult within member states and it is difficult between one member state and another due not only to historical and <OOV> <OOV> in terms of education but also to a <OOV> of other aspects <OOV> to this type of situation

804.5252075195312 finally i would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered and which may arise in the future will <OOV> be much less serious than those which have been brought up in <OOV> by people who study monetary union given that and this is our experience to date we are <OOV> an <OOV> of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room in monetary terms for us to confront difficulties more <OOV> than in the past

130.1419677734375 thank you very much for your answer which up to a point <OOV> many of the <OOV> i had expected

489.6133728027344 i should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can <OOV> with <OOV> in the trade cycle

59.89309310913086 what kind of large budget

163.92239379882812 is it a large eu budget which is being considered

278.5234069824219 i should also like to hear whether it can be <OOV> continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and <OOV> to the euro zone countries

122.82069396972656 for example <OOV> has in fact on a number of occasions <OOV> recommendations from the commission

389.0115966796875 is this state of <OOV> to be accepted in the long term or will the stability and growth pact be <OOV> up and a <OOV> environment <OOV> for emu by <OOV> working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and <OOV>

193.96298217773438 in your reply or comment i note two <OOV> questions

285.3659973144531 firstly a major budget is essential to tackle the <OOV> difficulties

444.324951171875 this would lead us into a very complex debate the problems are not caused by <OOV> themselves but by <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> on whether they are temporary or permanent whether they relate to <OOV> or demand

472.99755859375 we have little experience to help us define a <OOV> and <OOV> down a single <OOV> for <OOV> these difficulties by budgetary means

582.8743286132812 we believe that it is a much better idea to <OOV> a general framework of economic health of good economic <OOV> which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question

360.3146667480469 in the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact

145.16641235351562 i do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing but that is our <OOV> as the commission

372.7706298828125 this is an agreement adopted by the council of ministers as a result of initiatives by certain member states and which i also support since i believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for <OOV> in the event of difficulties

88.9080810546875 earlier i referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the member states

300.7691955566406 in this year s recommendations we have taken particular account of the commission s own <OOV> regarding what the <OOV> are and which <OOV> we are <OOV> in each of the member states to tackle the crisis without <OOV> the public <OOV> which is the figure we have established as a reference

280.8308410644531 we can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and therefore our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries although this is not the only <OOV> that we take into consideration

379.2523193359375 mr president the current <OOV> and <OOV> of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro zone

872.7098999023438 does the commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the <OOV> of the european central bank are sufficient to force the euro land states to make the difficult and fundamental <OOV> in their economic and labour markets which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the <OOV> financial markets

255.74412536621094 i do not see any great <OOV> between the two questions but i do note that the euro is being taken seriously

84.5687484741211 what has happened with the euro

57.806236267089844 there are many technical <OOV> as to why we are in this situation

653.6739501953125 this would require a <OOV> debate <OOV> on the <OOV> point which is the development of economic <OOV> and the real <OOV> of each of the areas it would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements such as <OOV> <OOV> for certain types of issues etc

202.29061889648438 the reality is that by <OOV> the euro on the basis <OOV> of the <OOV> of the exchange rate we are making an <OOV> <OOV> of its introduction

269.7003479003906 the euro has been a great success in terms of its introduction in terms of <OOV> it as a <OOV> in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in europe and in terms of the <OOV> for the future

116.73541259765625 it is true that the interest rate is not what we would have <OOV>

612.6939697265625 we believe that a strong economy means a strong euro

298.771728515625 we also believe that the development of growth in europe will be strong throughout and as a result we will <OOV> us growth by the end of this year

74.97562408447266 in these <OOV> we believe that the value of the euro will be <OOV> in the <OOV> months

448.8133850097656 therefore despite a certain degree of concern because that concern <OOV> within public opinion about the <OOV> of the euro we believe that this situation will be <OOV> and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent

395.4222412109375 mr president in my opinion the supplementary question by mr <OOV> was most <OOV> since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the emu countries has been <OOV> by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the us <OOV>

258.4964904785156 the reason for the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the usa is <OOV> than that of the euro countries

405.20977783203125 <OOV> of <OOV> of new jobs have recently been created in the usa while the number of jobs in europe has been cut

401.4716796875 i would like to ask the commissioner firstly whether the commission <OOV> that the weakening of the euro that has been much <OOV> out in public is a consequence of the <OOV> problems and lack of <OOV> of the eu economy particularly in relation to the usa and whether he really <OOV> that the kind of <OOV> action as proposed by mrs <OOV> would be the <OOV> for this weakening of the euro and whether he <OOV> that the commission will achieve better results in this matter when the national governments of france and germany have actually <OOV> in the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> and their actions have <OOV> even further the competitiveness of the euro area

231.73394775390625 as an example i refer here to the decisions made by the french government on working hours

255.93601989746094 i will try to reply briefly although these are complex questions and i will therefore have to give this point some attention

289.3506774902344 firstly with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of <OOV> economic policies i believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is <OOV> from this current crisis

116.19393920898438 the french president has <OOV> this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency

285.68707275390625 i do not <OOV> with the <OOV> that the euro s development is leading to a <OOV> in employment in europe and an increase in employment in the usa

156.30935668945312 transfers of <OOV> may <OOV> additional activity in the united states but the positive increase in <OOV> is <OOV> activity in europe

96.70423889160156 it would require a very complex and <OOV> debate to deal with this issue

483.321533203125 in any event what i do believe as i said earlier is that the euro at the moment has an exchange rate which if we <OOV> it in relation to its <OOV> and its historical situation is not that different from situations which have <OOV> at other times

97.79914093017578 i am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year

37.93651580810547 question no by h

1416.800537109375 subject precarious employment and the industrial <OOV> rate in spain and in the <OOV> region at the lisbon summit a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the eu

1104.7716064453125 in response to the french government s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper <OOV> jobs the approach agreed between the spanish and uk governments which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs has been adopted

561.1139526367188 spain s experience over the last four years has <OOV> that jobs are indeed created but are <OOV> <OOV> and precarious in nature and they are <OOV> with a high rate of industrial accidents the <OOV> region being the part of spain where that rate is <OOV>

411.5730895996094 does the commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various eu countries and regions so as to ensure that job creation is not at the <OOV> of the stability and <OOV> of workers and especially of <OOV> people <OOV> the job market for the first time

11.100179672241211 questions to mr

204.13856506347656 mr president despite the fact that i was <OOV> next to the <OOV> region it is difficult for me to <OOV> in community terms the problems of the precarious employment there

173.93841552734375 therefore allow me to make a rather more general comment

553.79833984375 the assessment of the labour market reforms which have <OOV> from the processes we have established in the union the luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy <OOV> that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to <OOV> the creation of employment and the greater <OOV> of <OOV> and <OOV> in the labour market

438.8893127441406 the broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have <OOV> <OOV> a simple deregulation of the labour market as the question states

796.913330078125 together with the reform of certain labour market regulations they also include for example the need to adopt measures which will promote <OOV> spirit or active labour market policies and we state this quite <OOV> to improve employment opportunities

257.6493835449219 the measures adopted in each member state must be <OOV> to the problems and reality of each of them

245.55014038085938 it is also quite normal for the commission to <OOV> on the need to <OOV> <OOV> and make agreements with social partners so that they may <OOV> <OOV> in the changes to the labour market in each country

384.7166748046875 as well as a significant and <OOV> increase in the levels of employment one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs

407.71026611328125 the recent lisbon summit gave a new <OOV> to the union s economic and social <OOV> and we have also <OOV> on this point by talking of more and better employment

341.0301208496094 i would also like to <OOV> as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now the promotion and <OOV> of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work which has been one of the most <OOV> issues in the debate <OOV> in the commission which <OOV> better jobs in europe

509.7320861816406 labour market reforms <OOV> at improving employment opportunities and workers <OOV> to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to <OOV> working conditions or health and safety at work

353.3201904296875 in accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the treaty the commission has <OOV> up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the <OOV> of the acquis <OOV> in this area

232.71253967285156 with regard to your specific question and the case of spain it is spain s responsibility like the other members to apply the commission s directives

194.6248779296875 it is also the responsibility of the member states to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions

540.361572265625 the commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law <OOV> and clearly to monitor all the issues relating to its application which is the responsibility of the national authorities

240.41287231445312 i am grateful to mr <OOV> for the intention <OOV> his reply which is to <OOV> and <OOV> concern for worker s conditions

367.2162780761719 nevertheless the political <OOV> of the lisbon summit <OOV> that there were two proposals one which was more social more <OOV> which came from the french prime <OOV> mr <OOV> and the other <OOV> from a previous agreement between mr <OOV> and mr <OOV> <OOV> the labour market and making it more flexible the <OOV> proposal <OOV> the day

326.2632141113281 if we take spain as an example it is clear that job <OOV> temporary employment and work accidents are on the increase

548.6909790039062 do you not therefore believe that it would be appropriate in the <OOV> of the treaty of amsterdam to <OOV> the social charter with specific instruments and measures as <OOV> with the five <OOV> points of the treaty of maastricht in order to guarantee full employment and employment quality and that it therefore not be left to the <OOV> of each of the countries

169.86854553222656 by way of <OOV> reference has been made to the number of work accidents in <OOV> because it has such a <OOV> <OOV> within spain that is why we are concerned

91.58988952636719 i <OOV> that was the reason for the reference to <OOV> and not the fact that i was <OOV> next to that <OOV>

122.37582397460938 with regard to the basic problem i would make a different comment

326.9232482910156 our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment

310.9496154785156 in the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year and in the specific <OOV> for spain we <OOV> refer to the need for the problems to be <OOV> amongst them the <OOV> of <OOV> which may be important with regard to temporary employment because we believe that a <OOV> should be made between <OOV> and flexibility which are two very different things

323.1082458496094 nevertheless you <OOV> a second <OOV> in your supplementary question which in my opinion is of great interest why do we not <OOV> the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the treaty of maastricht at the time

227.51666259765625 basically because they are two completely different types of figure

386.2952880859375 at maastricht what we put in place was compliance with obligations <OOV> on voluntary decisions adopted by the member states which form the european union

378.73712158203125 in the case of full employment the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective but which do not have a <OOV> <OOV> which <OOV> its objective

484.4383239746094 what we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to <OOV> towards full employment

479.9726257324219 when we <OOV> of full employment in the commission document which <OOV> as a basis for the debate in lisbon we <OOV> said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available <OOV> to the various <OOV> <OOV> and policies proposed by the commission full employment will be achieved

243.35244750976562 however this cannot be a political objective as in maastricht because it does not <OOV> on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them

159.68429565429688 i would like to say that in order to judge from <OOV> it is often necessary to understand the reality

348.7223205566406 in the countries of the <OOV> mediterranean and specifically in the region of <OOV> they have in recent years <OOV> <OOV> unemployment and started to manage employment

795.546142578125 they have <OOV> from an <OOV> and <OOV> level of unemployment <OOV> in the great state <OOV> whose economic model was <OOV> through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses <OOV> and economic incentives which have generated a new and <OOV> model

332.1141662597656 however it is clear that accidents in the <OOV> which i am now talking about are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of <OOV> the state public <OOV> and of course trade unions

75.11544799804688 unless they all work in <OOV> they will not achieve this objective

252.36703491210938 in spain back in a law was adopted in this respect and they are trying to comply with it but this cannot be achieved in a day

1110.3050537109375 therefore commissioner firstly what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area so that a sense of responsibility may be developed

148.83616638183594 secondly and very specifically is there any programme to <OOV> <OOV> in the <OOV> of their <OOV> country so that we can <OOV> them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is <OOV> to many <OOV> who do not speak our <OOV>

27.772672653198242 thank you for your comments

154.43992614746094 with regard to your questions i will say again that the <OOV> of responsibilities between the commission and the member states <OOV> that these matters <OOV> to the member states

381.50439453125 <OOV> both the funding of these <OOV> education programmes and the active policies are decisions which <OOV> <OOV> on which social policy the spanish government <OOV> or <OOV> on

37.93651580810547 question no by h

425.72332763671875 subject <OOV> of the applicant countries will the commission <OOV> the total number of documents that have been sent to the applicant countries as well as the total <OOV> of the acquis and will it consider forms of cooperation that do not require the applicant countries to <OOV> every rule

437.3896179199219 mr president ladies and gentlemen the entire community acquis i e all the legal acts of the european union without <OOV> were sent to the candidate countries immediately after the resolution of the luxembourg european council in december during the course of <OOV>

91.85482025146484 no one has <OOV> <OOV> them and i cannot therefore tell you how many there are

174.62596130371094 we <OOV> talk of just over legal acts in this context

45.21822738647461 mr president there is not very much to thank the commission for

458.87744140625 i find it completely <OOV> that there should be an institution which is unable to put together <OOV> <OOV> concerning the existing rules which is unable to add up how much money is being sent to the candidate countries which is unable to provide some general <OOV> information so that <OOV> people can follow what is <OOV> and which is unable to <OOV> the total acquis on a <OOV> <OOV> to <OOV> who might be interested in it

199.26113891601562 it is really quite simple i have worked on it for a good many years

453.1996765136719 it is completely impossible even for organisations with <OOV> employees to find out how extensive the acquis is and it is apparently impossible for mr <OOV> to give the entire acquis to a member of the european parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and <OOV> the <OOV> among the different employees in order to see what <OOV> are to be adopted on its various aspects

50.23447036743164 so there is nothing to thank the commission for

390.5762939453125 mr president mr <OOV> we have <OOV> each other face to face here before and i <OOV> am having to exercise a great deal of self control in order to <OOV> the necessary degree of <OOV> in the house

268.0682678222656 the legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts <OOV> by the council by parliament by the commission and by all the community institutions

217.1112060546875 you as a member of the most important legislative institution of the european union know full well that these legal acts have not been <OOV> <OOV>

170.18406677246094 i do not know of a single member state of the european union whose laws are <OOV> <OOV>

99.5461654663086 even the laws in your country and i have taken the <OOV> of finding out are not <OOV> <OOV>

310.56158447265625 if you think that commission <OOV> are well employed if i sit them down and tell them to <OOV> a week <OOV> the legal acts <OOV> since then let me tell you that i do not

55.97659683227539 i have no intention of <OOV> for them to be <OOV>

216.2467803955078 the information which i have given you is as <OOV> as possible i e that candidate countries are sent all i <OOV> all the legal acts of the european union without <OOV>

102.79615020751953 i am <OOV> to know how it <OOV> if i tell you that this figure is or

239.9441680908203 if you want you sit down and do it you can find the entire community acquis on line on the <OOV> <OOV> here in parliament

154.13705444335938 you tell your employees to <OOV> these legal acts because i shall not tell <OOV> to do so

116.47840881347656 mr president commissioner the acquis is of course an important basis for accession

83.9928970336914 can you tell us how acquis <OOV> is <OOV> in your view

173.72406005859375 with which candidate countries has most progress been made

43.13410186767578 which <OOV> have been completed

57.32715606689453 <OOV> <OOV> recently stated in a <OOV> conference that the first <OOV> will <OOV> be in

122.6576156616211 how do you <OOV> the scenario if the legal <OOV> is completed in <OOV> time

147.32760620117188 what do you think is the <OOV> possible date for accession if <OOV> use is made of all <OOV> and <OOV>

326.4039306640625 i can tell the honourable member that <OOV> i e legislative <OOV> was of course completed with all candidates some time ago

235.84535217285156 it is <OOV> now and again because the european parliament the council and the commission are not <OOV> and continue to <OOV> legal acts meaning that the acquis changes

97.29080963134766 this <OOV> acquis must of course be included in negotiations

50.55735778808594 but this happens on a <OOV> basis

153.08816528320312 the <OOV> process has therefore been completed with all candidates

30.543973922729492 your question is based on a <OOV>

103.78286743164062 <OOV> is not the same as negotiation <OOV> is merely an <OOV> process

239.34210205078125 <OOV> is used merely to <OOV> the acquis of the european union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country s legislation and how much does not

18.37421417236328 that has been done

206.59201049804688 now you want to know how far negotiations have <OOV> overall

403.1412353515625 i know that for the luxembourg group of countries with which negotiations started in march between and out of a total of negotiating <OOV> have been <OOV> completed

127.6059341430664 a few more will be completed during the portuguese presidency

120.2341079711914 but more important than the number of <OOV> completed is <OOV> the number of <OOV> opened

149.34849548339844 by the end of the portuguese presidency all <OOV> will be on the negotiating table for the luxembourg group of countries

150.26763916015625 only the <OOV> entitled institutions and <OOV> are still closed for obvious reasons

24.16132926940918 they come at the end

137.8713836669922 with the <OOV> group of countries negotiations did not start until february of this year

123.24140930175781 between and <OOV> will be opened for these countries during the portuguese presidency

172.59580993652344 indeed i think that we will be able to <OOV> <OOV> a whole <OOV> of <OOV> by the end of the portuguese presidency but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of <OOV>

24.93134307861328 in all <OOV> the process is <OOV> <OOV>

343.8353576660156 it is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first <OOV> will take place

93.08837890625 there have been <OOV> <OOV> on this over recent weeks and months

469.8685607910156 the commission stated quite clearly in <OOV> that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available

449.1361389160156 we need to clarify if the union itself is ready for accession i e if the <OOV> reforms have been completed how far negotiations have <OOV> and most <OOV> and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end if a candidate country is <OOV> to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted

313.509521484375 as things stand today i am <OOV> to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready

136.58984375 i have said on many occasions that i would like it to be ready by the end of this year at the <OOV> summit

325.24169921875 but whether or not that will be possible will only become <OOV> in the <OOV> of this year once we have the up to date progress reports on <OOV> for accession for each individual candidate country

211.28402709960938 mr president commissioner my question does not concern the timetable instead i would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement

883.7869873046875 the process of enlargement is expected to be a <OOV> demanding one in which there is a <OOV> that we either become <OOV> by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting <OOV> transition periods which will naturally cause <OOV> in the old member states

695.4630737304688 an arrangement such as the <OOV> agreement may be <OOV> as a solution of the past but i would nevertheless like to ask whether the commission could even in principle consider a possible solution along the lines of the <OOV> agreement not as it <OOV> but of that nature to be used as some sort of <OOV> or <OOV> for the new member states <OOV> to <OOV> membership instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership <OOV> a reality i would further like to ask whether the commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement along the lines of the <OOV> agreement could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries

62.42885208129883 i hope this question was not an <OOV> one at this time

70.7390365600586 <OOV> what you wish to <OOV> in now is a <OOV> discussion

355.5487365722656 this discussion was <OOV> in the first half of the and it <OOV> in <OOV> of which you are aware which were discussed on several occasions in parliament and which can no longer be made <OOV> namely the resolution of the european <OOV> of copenhagen <OOV> and luxembourg to prepare the central and eastern european countries and <OOV> and <OOV> for full membership

139.01071166992188 there is no point today in <OOV> whether or not there might have been an alternative

192.1632537841797 in any case it is my <OOV> that the candidates were not satisfied with <OOV> less

360.95697021484375 they would not have accepted less and would have seen it as <OOV> meaning that in luxembourg in there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case

304.0783386230469 there is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should <OOV> from this objective of full membership

43.58591842651367 if there were i would know about it

14.394648551940918 but there is not

420.1288757324219 all countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and i <OOV> <OOV> you against <OOV> a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has <OOV>

314.3874206542969 the candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust

37.93651580810547 question no by h

943.595458984375 subject <OOV> enlargement transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of services negotiations with the first group of applicant states the luxembourg group on the free movement of services have reached a <OOV> conclusion

60.28287887573242 what transitional arrangements have been agreed to date

885.3410034179688 what effects does the commission expect these to have on small businesses and self employed <OOV> workers particularly in the regions <OOV> on the applicant states

11.100179672241211 questions to mr

39.73188781738281 mrs <OOV> the question is based on an <OOV> <OOV>

722.1172485351562 the chapter entitled free movement of services has not been <OOV> completed with any candidate country

372.809814453125 nor do i expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future

341.38897705078125 mr president it is certainly <OOV> to say mr <OOV> that the chapter has not been completed but negotiations have started

365.6767883300781 however what i am interested in is this have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations

224.9217529296875 you know i am from a border region and i know exactly what the situation is on the ground

356.2142028808594 i am convinced that <OOV> <OOV> companies and the <OOV> industry will face huge problems and <OOV> challenges when it comes to the free movement of services because there is a huge <OOV> <OOV> of at present

201.26853942871094 you yourself know full well which <OOV> are affected

323.2888488769531 is there any intention on the european side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services

427.0167541503906 the czech republic has already applied for transition periods for the <OOV> of land by <OOV> and this will have an impact on services

326.6846008300781 what is your position on the transition periods which the czech republic has applied for and what is the commission s position in general on this point

274.0923156738281 mr president mrs <OOV> i <OOV> that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the member states not the commission <OOV> and i am not therefore entitled to <OOV> the <OOV> of negotiations which have not yet been completed

52.16457748413086 i would <OOV> do so but i am not allowed to

236.7705535888672 however i can still answer the question because the commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised

1221.0706787109375 first the commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date

267.2614440917969 transition periods must be very very <OOV> in both scope and <OOV> especially where the internal market is at <OOV>

267.9045104980469 you must know that every transition period <OOV> of <OOV> it benefits <OOV> the internal market for that area

375.76593017578125 and if a large number of transition periods are agreed then we can <OOV> the whole idea of the internal market for years to come

85.11499786376953 that cannot be the meaning of enlargement

512.4252319335938 the question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement

221.69219970703125 the region which you come from and the region which i come from are just such regions

195.010498046875 i have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country as you know and so i can be brief

585.4600830078125 i think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers which is the really difficult question

46.92397689819336 but we have not yet reached that point

502.0269470214844 in the area of the free movement of services which will lead to <OOV> competition in border regions i think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now particularly so that small and <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> in border regions will be <OOV> of <OOV> to and <OOV> this new competition

713.0698852539062 when a few weeks ago i once again read the commission s progress report on <OOV> it <OOV> to me that the progress reports are being <OOV> as if it were the previous enlargement we were talking about that is to say the enlargement which <OOV> place before the treaty of amsterdam came into force

281.6965026855469 the social chapter is the <OOV> and <OOV> of free movement of services and labour mobility

411.36712646484375 my question is about whether the forthcoming progress reports will to a greater degree than the previous reports take account of employment and of the social chapter which is now a part of our acquis

338.4398498535156 i believe in fact that we can succeed in <OOV> the union if we <OOV> these two aspects firstly the free movement of services and employees and secondly more <OOV> conditions when it comes to the dialogue between <OOV> and employees

217.80995178222656 the social chapter is in fact a part of our common regulations with which the candidate states must also comply

613.3512573242188 i would like to remind meps in general that questions during question time must be specific questions on specific issues which lead to specific answers

457.90557861328125 everything else must take place during the normal <OOV> of the <OOV> committees because otherwise the meps who are due to follow will not be able to put their questions

80.55547332763672 having given this general <OOV> i give the floor to the commissioner

132.98753356933594 mr president to be <OOV> the <OOV> question was how many legal acts does the european union have

320.07879638671875 now i am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country

378.2956848144531 i really cannot see the connection between these two questions <OOV> that both relate to enlargement

165.34078979492188 however if you take the view that there is a connection then i am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so

226.03518676757812 all the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries

282.8515625 the charter of fundamental rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready

84.41233825683594 it is only now being <OOV> and its legal <OOV> has not yet been <OOV>

223.1061248779297 i know no better than you if this charter will become part of the treaty or if it will be no more than a <OOV> <OOV>

334.74090576171875 if this charter should become part of the treaty it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the <OOV> of this charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned

203.80471801757812 we must also report in the progress reports as you will have <OOV> as to whether a country is <OOV> with the copenhagen criteria

516.3008422851562 that basically answers the questions because the political criteria of copenhagen basically <OOV> everything which will appear in this charter of fundamental rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to <OOV> and will be answered in the next progress report on <OOV>

29.253751754760742 mrs <OOV> is <OOV> a point of order

126.70883178710938 i wish to point out that i was not earlier <OOV> to mrs <OOV> but to all meps but you have the floor

62.286216735839844 i would ask you not to enter into a debate with the commissioner

816.4367065429688 commissioner i just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad <OOV> i was not talking about the charter of fundamental rights but about the social charter including the rights of workers

112.1124496459961 these include working conditions which i think are a <OOV> to the movement of services

118.40584564208984 what are the conditions under which services are provided

64.37693786621094 what are the conditions under which people are working

70.71614074707031 that is the <OOV> of free movement

281.7220153808594 mr president i did indeed hear the words charter of fundamental rights

274.5570983886719 of course the social charter forms part of the treaty and is therefore <OOV> with all candidate countries

59.87739562988281 it forms part of the community acquis

337.43963623046875 we report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis i e to apply the social charter

438.8695373535156 i am not at the moment in a position to tell you exactly how things stand with <OOV> in particular but i would be more than happy to give you a <OOV> reply specifically on <OOV> and the social charter

218.80169677734375 commissioner we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods

436.269287109375 i should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of <OOV> and the czech republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them namely the free <OOV> of land including <OOV> and the <OOV> of <OOV>

130.37417602539062 these are two very fundamental points and i should like to know what the commission or your position is on this

470.8052673339844 i also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the member states and the candidate countries in the sort of <OOV> deal that is constantly being discussed

170.72901916503906 on the first question i should like to say that the member states still have no negotiating position on this question nor is there any commission <OOV> on it

27.863643646240234 my own <OOV> opinion is <OOV>

103.88304901123047 in any case i cannot <OOV> it to the european parliament until the institutions have <OOV> their own opinion

399.2825927734375 as far as linking transition periods is concerned this happens <OOV>

250.56004333496094 we shall have a so called play <OOV> at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the member states still have and the wishes which the candidates have

331.3830261230469 basically their wishes concern transition periods

208.98599243164062 <OOV> of whether or not that is what it is <OOV> called you can <OOV> how this sort of negotiation process <OOV>

563.2218017578125 it will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a <OOV> so that the other side also makes a <OOV> and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes <OOV> of the wishes of both <OOV>

455.897705078125 highly specific <OOV> if that was your question <OOV> we also say we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not <OOV> in my opinion

777.6414184570312 i should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers for example only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen member states

50.07206726074219 it is a <OOV> problem and it is an <OOV> problem

199.15460205078125 it is not a problem for the other <OOV> which is why i cannot <OOV> exactly how this issue will be <OOV> in the final stage of negotiations

52.06517791748047 thank you very much mr commissioner for your <OOV>

32.245140075683594 questions <OOV> and will be <OOV> to in writing

41.86381912231445 mr <OOV> has the floor for a point of order

151.5937957763672  mr president you <OOV> this is the second <OOV> running you have done this to me cut me <OOV> as my question was <OOV> up

165.54405212402344 yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one <OOV> including a rather long and <OOV> dialogue about the <OOV> of <OOV>

297.22430419921875 also in the rules as i <OOV> you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being <OOV> and as a consequence for the second week running i <OOV> out on a question

53.910465240478516 i think it is absolutely <OOV> and i will be writing to the president to <OOV>

124.7566909790039 mr <OOV> i will reply briefly so as not to <OOV> the other meps

53.83809280395508 i am not getting at you

289.839599609375 what has happened is that the <OOV> <OOV> to mr <OOV> have run out and it is now mr <OOV> s turn to reply and he has been waiting some time

142.37234497070312 with regard to the rules of procedure i must tell you that there are two supplementary questions not one

40.84501647949219 please read the rules of procedure

24.223743438720703 there are two questions

60.00668716430664 i am not going to get into a debate

324.4522705078125 you may <OOV> the letter you mentioned and you will receive a <OOV> and full reply but please do not <OOV> since my intention was to give you the floor within the time <OOV>

37.93651580810547 question no by h

323.0850830078125 subject <OOV> by member states regarding state aids is the commission happy about the speed with which it <OOV> with <OOV> by member states to provide state aids

298.8004150390625 the time limits for the commission to take a decision on aid projects <OOV> by a member state are laid down in council regulation

181.65357971191406 in most cases the commission can <OOV> the examination of the <OOV> aid project after the <OOV> examination that is without <OOV> a formal investigation

177.1299591064453 such decisions must be taken within two months following the <OOV> of a <OOV> notification

135.13865661621094 in practice <OOV> are frequently <OOV> so that the commission is <OOV> to request additional information before it can take a decision

511.5928039550781 in order to further reduce this type of <OOV> delay the commission has prepared <OOV> <OOV> notification forms for certain types of aid regional training <OOV> <OOV> etc and will continue to do so where appropriate

527.4573974609375 when doubts are raised about the <OOV> of an aid project with the common market the commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an <OOV> time limit of months

142.54493713378906 the commission would certainly <OOV> to be able to reduce this time limit

71.52610778808594 however this seems at present not <OOV> for different reasons

322.2853088378906 firstly considerable time is needed for <OOV> and publication of the decision for third parties to <OOV> observations and for the member states to comment on these observations

312.5202941894531 secondly the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are <OOV> very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination often also involving <OOV> with the member state concerned and <OOV> to the <OOV> project

329.735595703125 nevertheless the commission <OOV> that given the <OOV> of any time limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation the regulation has already brought some progress

339.11090087890625 the commission is also considering new ways of improving the <OOV> and speed of state aid procedures

354.3085021972656 in this regard the group exemption regulations which are currently being prepared for aid to <OOV> training aid and <OOV> <OOV> aid should be mentioned

420.7420959472656 once they are in force member states will no longer need to <OOV> aid projects <OOV> with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can <OOV> the aid immediately

163.89833068847656 this will considerably <OOV> state aid procedures

396.4670715332031 i wish to thank the commissioner for that very full answer and in particular for the last part where he <OOV> that the commission is <OOV> at <OOV> up and where possible giving fast track approval for state aids

469.39892578125 however in some member states there is still a serious problem created by <OOV> in decision taking on state aids

298.0165710449219 i am convinced that some jobs have been <OOV> because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a <OOV> has <OOV> out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time

415.2138671875 in terms of the delay is the commission of the opinion that the <OOV> that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the <OOV> of state aids or does the problem <OOV> as he <OOV> indicated with the member states in the <OOV> information provided by some of them when they make an application

271.0838317871094 as you know mr <OOV> we are working in a number of <OOV> concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more <OOV>

219.95611572265625 as to time limits there are no plans to change the time limits in the <OOV> future

260.5469055175781 the <OOV> are laid down in a council regulation which for the first time <OOV> state aid procedures and since that regulation was only adopted in it is not likely to be <OOV> in the <OOV> future

463.5492248535156 however we are prepared and indeed <OOV> to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision making <OOV> possible for example preparing the <OOV> notification forms

56.767486572265625 you mentioned the problem of resources

148.3058319091797 of course this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that <OOV> state aid

177.17727661132812 the better the quality of information provided to <OOV> with by member states in their <OOV> the more likely it is that the process will be <OOV> and <OOV> in a <OOV> short time scale

37.93651580810547 question no by h

2036.5953369140625 subject state aids to nuclear <OOV> given that the electricity market came into effect in february last <OOV> all electricity production to the rules of the internal market and that the nuclear common market under article of the euratom treaty does not include electricity as a product does the commission <OOV> that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity

548.8251953125 does the commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are <OOV> by the ec treaty given that no <OOV> is <OOV> and that article of the euratom treaty does not provide for a <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> scheme for nuclear <OOV>

545.3889770507812 in this context what proposals if any has the commission made to the uk government concerning their <OOV> system under article of the ec treaty

233.5237274169922 can the commission now <OOV> that it is <OOV> state aids to the nuclear industry as <OOV> by the green <OOV> group in its letter to commissioner <OOV> of march

1091.658203125 mr president the commission shares the opinion of the honourable member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity including electricity generated using nuclear energy

344.574462890625 the commission <OOV> that there are no grounds for <OOV> the ec or the euratom treaty as <OOV> <OOV> all state aids to the nuclear industry

323.8272399902344 the euratom treaty does not include any <OOV> specifically <OOV> state aid

766.4761962890625 <OOV> while articles and of the ec treaty do provide for a general principle <OOV> state aids they also <OOV> specific categories of state aid

288.69219970703125 it would only be possible to <OOV> the <OOV> of aid following specific investigation of each case

393.2392883300781 the commission has not made any proposals to the uk government on the subject of the <OOV> system in application of article of the ec treaty

786.795654296875 as <OOV> any existing aid to the nuclear industry the commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation

503.480712890625 if however cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the commission such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the ec and euratom treaties

103.9930648803711 commissioner thank you for your response but i must <OOV> i find it hard to <OOV> the <OOV> of it

412.2974548339844 on the one <OOV> regarding state aid to the environment you expect to implement a very thorough <OOV> of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that for the time being this sector is at a <OOV> due to the <OOV> of costs

658.9360961914062 in other words the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is <OOV>

288.33575439453125 <OOV> that nuclear energy <OOV> to of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation

472.7037048339844 i do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this if the <OOV> of your energy policy is <OOV> to be fair <OOV> all forms of electricity production alike

340.62646484375 i must therefore ask you to <OOV> your position since as far as i am concerned and also many others most especially the renewable energy industry it is a position which is extremely difficult to <OOV>

14.930720329284668 thank you mr <OOV>

234.97628784179688 i am very aware of environmental requirements as i was even in the previous commission when i proposed the directive on the <OOV> of energy <OOV> and i try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the <OOV> commission

458.3001708984375 i very clearly understand your concern but permit me some observations

715.9698486328125 the proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies

436.0729064941406 it <OOV> aid of at least of <OOV> costs in the case of investment and for operational aid the member states are entitled to adopt a system <OOV> aid up to of <OOV> costs

171.5242919921875 i do not think therefore that you can <OOV> the commission of <OOV> aid to renewable energies

1072.2794189453125 there is some competition again permit me the <OOV> not only between renewable energies as <OOV> to conventional energies but also between the various forms of renewable energies

246.6656951904297 aid to these forms of energy may <OOV> vary according to the member states

642.16796875 <OOV> aid would therefore <OOV> distortions of competition which could have an <OOV> impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy

650.6974487304688 the commission <OOV> that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to <OOV> but at the same time it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to <OOV> markets in order to ensure their long term development

37.93651580810547 question no by h

885.8768920898438 subject financial aid given to the european nuclear industry what assessment has been made by the commission of the financial aid given to the european nuclear industry in the form of support for euratom and the joint research <OOV> in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the european union

247.49156188964844 community action within the context of the euratom treaty <OOV> with the provisions of the treaty and <OOV> in particular to the <OOV> of the commission s <OOV> protection against <OOV> monitoring safety and research

550.2103271484375 as far as the <OOV> is concerned community programmes for nuclear research are established by the council which <OOV> to article of the euratom treaty acts unanimously on commission proposals

347.6878662109375 in this context the activities of the <OOV> are intended in <OOV> with its <OOV> to increase protection and nuclear safety and in particular provide scientific and technical assistance to the <OOV> <OOV> general

313.3682556152344 article <OOV> article of the ec treaty <OOV> that the provisions of this treaty do not <OOV> from the euratom treaty

457.9248046875 this is particularly true in the case of the competition rules which do not <OOV> from the framework established by the euratom treaty regarding community nuclear research

422.17413330078125 therefore the community research policy under the euratom treaty does not <OOV> the competition rules laid down by the ec treaty

56.00433349609375 commissioner you have failed to answer my question

178.60220336914062 i want to know what <OOV> you are making on financial aid

214.6427764892578 this <OOV> to the previous question by mr <OOV> as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the eu

258.74530029296875 i <OOV> from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white <OOV> in the nuclear industry in europe but a <OOV> <OOV>

194.88140869140625 you can provide state aids that are <OOV> even by a commissioner as <OOV> as yourself

101.1559066772461 but let me ask you what exactly is the situation

226.95465087890625 you said that under the treaties there are derogations and you <OOV> the euratom treaty

123.40345764160156 there is clearly a <OOV> between member states because of the state aids

153.7255859375 where exactly in the treaty are the <OOV> <OOV> for these state aids

25.733726501464844 could you <OOV> on that please

45.27465057373047 i shall try mrs <OOV>

176.82876586914062 first of all if you allow me i have here a note in french

215.47154235839844 i should like to <OOV> that the commission does not rule out <OOV> the rules of community law on competition to public <OOV> in favour of nuclear electricity producers

1114.461669921875 in its <OOV> nuclear programme according to article of the euratom treaty in particular the commission very clearly indicated that developments towards the liberalisation of the community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to <OOV> in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy <OOV>

644.31591796875 a full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules <OOV> a level <OOV> field for all energy <OOV>

186.76161193847656 once this principle has been established it is up to the commission to <OOV> on an individual basis any <OOV> according to which the nuclear sector is in <OOV> of subsidies <OOV> <OOV> competition

127.3018569946289 i may add that the services i am <OOV> responsible for within the commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a <OOV> <OOV> of the treaty

324.003662109375 competition rules are <OOV> to all electricity producers including the nuclear sector <OOV> as they do not <OOV> from the terms of the euratom treaty

270.8907470703125 i consider this position to be all the more <OOV> since the directive <OOV> the internal electricity market does not <OOV> any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any <OOV> on the grounds of the <OOV> of the electricity <OOV>

953.1185913085938 commissioner you say that neither the treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market <OOV> any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector

273.7437438964844 on what part of the treaty then is the exemption that you are still <OOV> the nuclear industry based

238.32521057128906 articles and make no reference to nuclear energy

568.229736328125 so it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy

70.44491577148438 i believe i have given you all the information available to the commission on the subject

524.419677734375 i can add that on the operational level as indeed i think i said in response to your own question mr <OOV> on existing aid to the nuclear industry the commission is not undertaking a <OOV> investigation

393.7769470214844 if however cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties

462.2319030761719 i would further like to add that in the logical overall <OOV> of the ec treaty the articles <OOV> state aid i e articles and are not <OOV> to specific sectors

60.24296569824219 since the time <OOV> to questions to the commission has <OOV> questions <OOV> to will be <OOV> to in writing

19.196409225463867 that <OOV> questions to the commission

60.81193542480469  the <OOV> was <OOV> at <OOV> m and <OOV> at <OOV> m

51.132476806640625 <OOV> <OOV> emissions from new

431.7785949707031 the next item is the report by mr <OOV> <OOV> on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of from new <OOV> cars

116.55667114257812 mr president there are few of us here at this time in the <OOV> but it is also true that this is the third time we have <OOV> this report in the european parliament

219.05259704589844 on the first <OOV> in december this report on the reduction of <OOV> <OOV> emissions from new <OOV> cars was approved at first reading with amendments

98.04444885253906 of those amendments the council and commission accepted some in their <OOV> and others only in part

40.27645492553711 the report therefore <OOV> for a second reading

265.7607421875 the council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important but there <OOV> certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy and by a large <OOV> in <OOV> <OOV> which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted

721.5543823242188 we are basically talking about the <OOV> in this scheme to reduce <OOV> <OOV> emissions from new cars of <OOV> industrial cars which are used <OOV> within <OOV> and whose <OOV> <OOV> emissions also <OOV>

138.78585815429688 it also <OOV> to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data

210.64743041992188 for a scheme of this nature <OOV> and <OOV> in terms of the data <OOV> by the governments are essential

150.417724609375 it also <OOV> very important that we <OOV> something that was <OOV> in the <OOV> of the committee on the environment a certain degree of <OOV> in relation to voluntary agreements

226.1107177734375 if we <OOV> in mind that community law directives and regulations is often not <OOV> with it seems to us all the more <OOV> that voluntary agreements will be <OOV> with

402.8941650390625 the committee on the environment had little <OOV> in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the <OOV> of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed

169.0902862548828 they also finally accepted our concern that one of the <OOV> should not only <OOV> the <OOV> of emissions but also their reduction

93.40830993652344 another amendment which we felt was important concerned the <OOV> of vehicles

288.01007080078125 mr president in total amendments were approved by a <OOV> <OOV> in this house and then not accepted by the council and we therefore had to <OOV> on this conciliation procedure which i must point out has been neither difficult nor <OOV>

463.640625 as its very <OOV> <OOV> the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached

99.73684692382812 in this final agreement our main concerns have been <OOV>

719.0188598632812 it <OOV> a study of the future <OOV> of <OOV> industrial vehicles the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less <OOV> in each of the countries

273.19598388671875 in short parliament s main concerns have been taken up if not in an immediate and <OOV> <OOV> at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future

84.33943939208984 the only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to <OOV> of vehicles

124.3823013305664 parliament <OOV> to <OOV> that this was very important because the more <OOV> and <OOV> the <OOV> the greater its level of emissions and we considered it important that this be included in one of the <OOV>

494.1265869140625 however <OOV> in mind that another six issues relating to the <OOV> and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted we felt that we could not <OOV> the conciliation process any longer particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of <OOV> <OOV> emissions from new <OOV> cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries

192.97740173339844 finally i believe that this is a reasonable agreement which is neither parliament s nor the council s <OOV> proposal

79.34082794189453 mr president i believe that we will have no problem <OOV> that this agreement is approved

164.12420654296875 mrs <OOV> <OOV> conciliation processes vary in <OOV> i can <OOV> you

29.431459426879883 i am <OOV> that this one has <OOV> <OOV>

101.64093017578125 mr president commissioner allow me to start by <OOV> mrs <OOV> <OOV>

238.64523315429688 she really is most <OOV> because we had a very good report at second reading as it was but she was <OOV> to <OOV> more proposed amendments and i really must congratulate her on <OOV> in doing so

60.19438171386719 parliament has <OOV> itself against the council once again

410.2177429199219 the introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many <OOV> on the <OOV> towards compliance with the kyoto protocol

285.3017578125 reducing greenhouse gases by in comparison with is therefore the main objective between now and the year

146.93504333496094 the <OOV> change in the climate has been <OOV> here in <OOV> over the past two <OOV> and is far greater than we <OOV>

184.9040069580078 it will therefore come as no <OOV> if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow as will certainly be the case and that the council and parliament have been able to find a common position so <OOV>

232.5989532470703 this joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and i think that its success or <OOV> will <OOV> whether or not we <OOV> to introduce other <OOV> <OOV>

693.7780151367188 we have taken <OOV> to a three part strategy in order to reduce emissions and <OOV> consumption environmental agreements with the car industry a system of <OOV> incentives and a system of <OOV> for <OOV> consumption and emissions

555.551025390625 but despite all these efforts directives and joint <OOV> <OOV> we should not <OOV> ourselves we are <OOV> to achieve the <OOV> objective of reducing greenhouse gases to levels

354.8651123046875 some <OOV> are <OOV> us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels

324.0814208984375 that may well be <OOV> but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the member states <OOV> <OOV> me i meant we <OOV> often have to <OOV> and ask ourselves if there are or member states but there are in fact still and if we consider enlargement to the <OOV> and if we consider that people in china and <OOV> also want to <OOV> as we do then we should make no <OOV> it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or and we should therefore make every <OOV> to stabilise them at the very least

143.20135498046875 despite all the <OOV> <OOV> a <OOV> european monitoring system for emissions will not do any <OOV>

274.7768249511719 let us try yet again with one small <OOV> at a time and <OOV> the house will sit in when we need to <OOV> the <OOV> results and <OOV> that <OOV> we did not do enough today

219.05963134765625 mr president commissioner trust is good control is even better as the <OOV> of state of a now <OOV> system used to say

564.1026611328125 nonetheless once in a while these words of <OOV> <OOV> the <OOV> because our strategy for cars is of course a new <OOV> in that we are <OOV> in the <OOV> of car manufacturers in europe <OOV> and <OOV> to take voluntary technical measures to reduce emissions from their cars to by which will <OOV> a reduction of around

113.81751251220703 but we do still need a control <OOV> so that we can <OOV> if necessary

139.26083374023438 <OOV> trust is good control is even better

534.0504150390625 we want a <OOV> <OOV> control <OOV> at our <OOV> and in this respect i thank the rapporteur for her <OOV> in establishing a reasonable control <OOV> for emissions from cars in europe which applies to all member states which clearly shows which vehicles are <OOV> where and what their emissions are so that we can see clearly in if the manufacturers <OOV> are being <OOV> or not

113.9047622680664 and if they are not then we must take legislative measures

296.7195129394531 i should like to refer to another two <OOV> in our strategy the question of <OOV> which has been dealt with and the question of additional <OOV> incentives for low consumption vehicles which is still a <OOV> <OOV> point

205.80697631835938 i think that all of us especially of course the member states need to give clear additional incentives so that we really can achieve our objective of <OOV> in

246.9176788330078 mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to congratulate our rapporteur on the excellent results that she has achieved and to <OOV> by <OOV> this report in the <OOV> context of climate change

204.05117797851562 since the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> conference and then kyoto the european union has always <OOV> the political side of the debate on climate change

93.08447265625 nevertheless although europe <OOV> to lead the debate in terms of <OOV> it is <OOV> to <OOV> the <OOV> to do so in a <OOV> way

271.10052490234375 it is rather <OOV> for the european union to try to <OOV> the whole world with this problem when in reality the european greenhouse <OOV> <OOV> in particular the <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> is more likely to increase by to than to <OOV> by the that we agreed in kyoto

217.21542358398438 it is therefore time to take internal action in order to <OOV> <OOV> to our external efforts

212.28086853027344 in terms of political action the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons

498.2204895019531 firstly because according to the green paper published by the european commission this sector will not be part of the european <OOV> system for <OOV> <OOV> emissions and all greenhouse <OOV> <OOV> will therefore have to be achieved <OOV> through national and community policies and measures

167.13690185546875 secondly because transport is the sector that is <OOV> most to europe s <OOV> short of the levels set in kyoto

387.1770935058594 according to a study recently published by the european environment <OOV> transport is responsible for almost of the european union s total emissions and it <OOV> that the level of <OOV> <OOV> emissions generated by this sector will increase by of the level by

330.1469421386719 given this extremely <OOV> <OOV> which shows that road transport is responsible for of total <OOV> <OOV> emissions in the transport sector and given the <OOV> need for action the agreement reached in the conciliation committee on this system for monitoring emissions from <OOV> <OOV> vehicles is to be <OOV>

867.96044921875 this system is a crucial <OOV> in the implementation of the kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce <OOV> <OOV> emissions in new <OOV> vehicles by

80.98129272460938 i <OOV> the fact that it has not been possible to include <OOV> <OOV> vehicles in this system

239.6739959716797 in any event i congratulate mrs <OOV> <OOV> once again on the results she has achieved

309.1857604980469 mr president commissioner i intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure

292.3921813964844 however let me just offer her my <OOV> <OOV> on her excellent report and <OOV> success as some of the previous speakers have done

534.1444091796875 <OOV> to some previous speakers i think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise <OOV> of greenhouse gases but to reduce them especially given the fact that we need to achieve a <OOV> success by under the terms of the kyoto protocol

602.1353759765625 i think it is fundamental given the <OOV> which this parliament has always <OOV> in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements that we have managed to include the <OOV> <OOV> that data will be used from <OOV> to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry

330.5306701660156 i also think that it is fundamental and the scope is not <OOV> by this decision that we have managed to bring the commission so far down the line that it is <OOV> into <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> for the specific emissions from <OOV> vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect

62.557342529296875 i think that is a huge success

75.33952331542969 i should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report

74.34184265136719 mr president i welcome the excellent result reached by the european parliament and the council on this <OOV>

114.76493835449219 i congratulate the <OOV> <OOV> on their efforts in finding a <OOV> and <OOV> agreement

235.2027130126953 the process leading to the approval of this proposal <OOV> a prime example of how the two <OOV> of the european <OOV> can <OOV> their differences and work together towards <OOV> of <OOV> and <OOV> environmental law

322.673828125 i should like to <OOV> the opportunity to thank the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection and in particular the rapporteur mrs <OOV> <OOV> for its constructive approach

723.5909423828125 the <OOV> of this decision will allow the <OOV> of the community strategy to reduce emissions from <OOV> cars to be <OOV> and more specifically it will provide <OOV> data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers

135.28622436523438 this strategy is one of the most <OOV> activities of the community on emissions and <OOV> from the transport sector

50.27193832397461 therefore it <OOV> an important <OOV> in the <OOV> of the kyoto <OOV>

26.570436477661133 mr president <OOV> i have <OOV> something

187.56784057617188 it will take me just <OOV> to <OOV> my <OOV> to all the members of the conciliation committee to mr provan to mrs <OOV> who also <OOV> and to the members of the commission and the council with <OOV> we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report

82.95927429199219 furthermore i would like to thank all the meps for their support

20.298181533813477 the debate is closed

73.64190673828125 the vote will take place tomorrow at a m

41.718666076660156 <OOV> of the trans european rail

187.9522705078125 the next item is the joint debate on the following reports tabled by mr <OOV> on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism

214.86160278320312  on the report from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the implementation and effects of directive ec concerning the <OOV> of the trans european high speed rail system

126.39856719970703  on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the <OOV> of the trans european conventional rail system

189.1041259765625 mr president i hope that the two members due to speak before me were not <OOV> by train and have been <OOV>

45.12739181518555 i think they are in the house and will <OOV> in time

70.65611267089844 <OOV> the fact of the matter is that we are <OOV> <OOV> problems on the railways which are a <OOV> from the past

119.15176391601562 for example in the railways share of the <OOV> traffic market was <OOV> with just now

116.94810485839844 the railways have <OOV> out <OOV> in <OOV> traffic and their share of the <OOV> traffic market has <OOV> from to

188.4730224609375 the <OOV> has been road <OOV> traffic which is increasing constantly and <OOV> market shares per <OOV> on the eastern <OOV> of <OOV> for example

40.42887878417969 it is now times <OOV> than in

104.4941635131836 if you take <OOV> and <OOV> from eastern europe on the <OOV> which is the most important <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> traffic increased <OOV> between and the year

93.10328674316406 in other words <OOV> traffic especially <OOV> <OOV> traffic is <OOV> <OOV>

72.73055267333984 according to <OOV> it will rise by more than between and

157.3004913330078 that is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the european rail network

141.5422821044922 it <OOV> <OOV> in length of which km are <OOV> for by the <OOV> network

929.9318237304688 km of new lines for <OOV> of over km h should be <OOV> by with at least km of lines due to be <OOV> for <OOV> of over km h the total costs and they are huge are <OOV> at eur billion between now and

195.4813995361328 so it is obvious how important this investment is for the european union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities <OOV>

322.88421630859375 i think that it is high time we <OOV> the railways to the market economy so as to ensure that the railways <OOV> more money more often in <OOV> requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a <OOV> efficient timetable

374.2912292480469 the main requirements are of course to harmonise the gauge throughout europe especially where more than two countries <OOV>

82.76939392089844 at the moment we still have five different <OOV>

60.532318115234375 we need <OOV> <OOV> especially in relation to <OOV> and <OOV>

368.1714782714844 in other words the technical <OOV> of the electricity must be brought into line so that <OOV> electricity can be <OOV> from the national <OOV> and <OOV> into the national <OOV> without any significant <OOV>

53.537872314453125 the third and i think the most important point is the safety of <OOV>

508.6948547363281 we really do need external inspection and certification agencies

113.8810043334961 we cannot have a situation in which the <OOV> operating the railway is also responsible for <OOV> it

312.7477722167969 no one questions the fact that cars and <OOV> are <OOV> by external certification agencies

359.6576843261719 i think there is an urgent need given the recent train <OOV> for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of <OOV> in europe

168.9103546142578 mr president first of all i should like to thank all the members who <OOV> the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are i believe absolutely crucial to the future of the railways

23.010942459106445 what is the subject matter

107.05235290527344 the first report <OOV> the application of the directive on the <OOV> of the high speed rail system <OOV> the <OOV> of this for the future

125.34331512451172 next and this is the <OOV> of the second report we must <OOV> and vote on a proposed directive on the <OOV> of the trans european conventional rail system

92.07063293457031 ladies and gentlemen we must <OOV> the full importance of this subject

150.08462524414062 there is today an <OOV> <OOV> between what is said in <OOV> and the reality of european transport systems

362.604736328125 as might have been expected the creation of the internal market has <OOV> considerably developed the trade in <OOV> and the mobility of <OOV> within the union which have <OOV> an increase of and <OOV> between and

287.7019348144531 the <OOV> of the traffic from this <OOV> growth in internal mobility which is expected to be <OOV> in the next few <OOV> has been <OOV> by road systems and <OOV> maritime <OOV> <OOV> the <OOV> sea

480.36480712890625 at a time when we have right here in most of the countries of the union a rail network and technology <OOV> in the world with a recent study <OOV> the external costs of road transport in terms of public health infrastructure and <OOV> at some eur billion even though the objective of <OOV> mobility and respect for quality of <OOV> are now <OOV> by all <OOV> it can be <OOV> that rail has only an market share for <OOV> and for <OOV> transport

518.7962646484375 there is more than one <OOV> for this <OOV> rail s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social <OOV> in relation to the road sector but also the distortions of competition <OOV> by the considerable external costs of road transport the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given <OOV> to <OOV> high speed <OOV> transport but also <OOV> national characteristics in terms of railway <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> the <OOV> of <OOV> rail traffic

175.92373657226562 today the situation of the european transport network situation is simple to the point of <OOV> there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network

436.1075134277344 there is no longer any single <OOV> or european maritime area nor especially a <OOV> railway area within the countries of the union

345.4942321777344 the issue at <OOV> in railway <OOV> is of course doing away with the technical <OOV> that have been <OOV> from the national railway <OOV> set in place gradually since the <OOV> century

465.9427795410156 today the europe of the fifteen has no less than <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> systems six <OOV> <OOV> five track <OOV> and several equipment and therefore infrastructure <OOV>

640.50244140625 of course the new high speed train <OOV> offer a prime area for the introduction of <OOV> since they are new or recent networks <OOV> to very <OOV> technology

23.307783126831055 directive was adopted for this <OOV>

315.0491027832031 the report on its application four years on referred to parliament to <OOV> an opinion <OOV> <OOV> results but results that are in the end more positive than they may <OOV>

302.3576965332031 in the first place significant delay is <OOV> in the transposition of laws and regulations since to date only two countries have transposed it and the first technical <OOV> for <OOV> are on the point of being completed and published

264.83905029296875 the conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more <OOV> in future

675.6179809570312 this delay in <OOV> into law has not however <OOV> the development of <OOV> cross border lines although <OOV> is the only example of true <OOV> more so than even <OOV> despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem

254.1695556640625 these two international lines have established a <OOV> which can <OOV> as a model for future developments

412.5566101074219 more than that however in <OOV> of <OOV> results in future the directive on the <OOV> of high speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and <OOV> out working methods

511.2010498046875 for the first time the railway industry rail companies and infrastructure <OOV> have started up a joint project to define the technical <OOV> for <OOV>

243.04766845703125 they have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the international union of railways

480.8605651855469 within the european <OOV> for railway <OOV> <OOV> they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems

434.0611572265625 finally the committee established by article <OOV> together representatives of the member states and the commission <OOV> political and technical monitoring of <OOV> projects and intervention at the <OOV> of states to direct such projects

622.9798583984375 in other words while the committee on regional policy transport and tourism felt <OOV> to remind the member states of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition it must be <OOV> that the high speed systems have provided a first rate <OOV> ground for the <OOV> <OOV> of <OOV>

643.3224487304688 in this respect we have to <OOV> in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are <OOV> in other ways due to the national and historical characteristics of networks the great <OOV> of the stock and the considerable extent of the networks

244.1571502685547 it must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of <OOV> that rail companies and infrastructure <OOV> immediately <OOV> to <OOV> their equipment <OOV> this is <OOV> out of reach <OOV>

224.234130859375 in the first place if the goal is to achieve <OOV> this must <OOV> using the <OOV> and least <OOV> means to achieve <OOV> progress

516.4112548828125 in this respect <OOV> may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different <OOV> following the example of the <OOV> system <OOV>

232.01918029785156 this is a proposal for a <OOV> and realistic approach which would not <OOV> from railways competitiveness in relation to other <OOV> of transport by <OOV> additional costs

702.3025512695312 the key principles of this proposed directive are as <OOV> restriction of the <OOV> area <OOV> by conventional system <OOV> to the trans european network as defined by the european parliament and council decision a policy of gradual <OOV> rather than systematic <OOV> taking the form of <OOV> in priorities and <OOV> establishing a <OOV> for <OOV> to enable the <OOV> and <OOV> access with priority only to new investment for creating extending <OOV> <OOV> and operating systems establishing a <OOV> of objectives <OOV> <OOV> the board objectives to be included in all standards safety <OOV> health environmental protection and technical <OOV> the objectives <OOV> in each technical <OOV> infrastructure energy rolling stock etc the <OOV> of the technical <OOV> of <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> to a joint <OOV> body from the <OOV> work <OOV> to the european standards <OOV> and the inspection and certification <OOV> to <OOV> <OOV> a policy of <OOV> <OOV> as suggested by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism which cannot be <OOV> ladies and gentlemen without <OOV> <OOV> of staff representatives the subject of an amendment that we shall be discussing tomorrow finally <OOV> monitoring of these projects by the member states and the commission through the committee established under article implemented by the high speed directive <OOV> states to request exemptions to include special cases in the technical <OOV> for purely <OOV> or regional networks as well as certain types of equipment <OOV> from third countries and also instruments for <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> by member states to the commission

3.3078558444976807 

335.5627136230469 in other words there are safety <OOV> for countries with a high level of special characteristics and within the institutions <OOV> by the directive they still have the opportunity to <OOV> the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the <OOV> <OOV>

137.06124877929688 finally during the transition period it is important to <OOV> the networks from <OOV> further <OOV>

117.94019317626953 to this end new <OOV> between now and the publication of the <OOV> shall have to comply with <OOV> technical <OOV>

526.803955078125 a union rolling stock <OOV> will be set up making it possible to <OOV> the rolling stock its <OOV> and <OOV> in the same way that this is still carried out albeit <OOV> for the maritime fleet

591.5919799804688 furthermore we have to look to the future and therefore both the committee on regional policy transport and tourism and the committee on industry external trade research and energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this <OOV> stage so that they can <OOV> this future acquis <OOV>

148.94076538085938 <OOV> and this is a <OOV> that we make we should already be <OOV> conditions of <OOV> between the various <OOV> of transport in accordance with our general objective of developing <OOV> <OOV>

218.093994140625 it would of course be <OOV> to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long term <OOV> work it <OOV> from railway <OOV>

399.341064453125 quite clearly europe is <OOV> to <OOV> a long term and very large scale project throughout its <OOV> railway network

393.603271484375 it cannot single <OOV> solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or <OOV> which would <OOV> crucial progress towards a new <OOV> <OOV> of rail in europe

513.5687255859375 all the same the technical <OOV> of our old national networks is indeed an essential <OOV> for the <OOV> of rail which this <OOV> reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual <OOV> under acceptable economic and social conditions

60.227359771728516 to the many of you who <OOV> to this let me <OOV> my <OOV> and my <OOV>

324.0205078125 mr president commissioner honourable members i should like to start by <OOV> the rapporteur mr <OOV> and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult purely technical subject

207.611083984375 the number of proposed amendments tabled including here in <OOV> shows how important this issue is for europe which is why i can also <OOV> the commission for <OOV> the subject of the <OOV> of conventional <OOV> as well as of high speed <OOV>

146.593994140625 i think it is a <OOV> that few member states have transposed the <OOV> directive with regard to high speed <OOV> and i <OOV> on the commission to <OOV> <OOV> to <OOV> the <OOV> of <OOV> time which is <OOV> the railways in terms of market shares and competition

109.22221374511719 the directive is even more important where conventional <OOV> are concerned

434.2232360839844 the aim of the directive as with high speed <OOV> is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the union <OOV> as <OOV> as possible and to give candidate countries really <OOV> <OOV> so that through traffic is also <OOV> after enlargement

51.08467102050781 <OOV> will also have many <OOV> for both <OOV> and <OOV> transport

383.15179443359375 better services greater <OOV> less <OOV> time increased safety and possibly also lower prices

114.83782958984375 the harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long <OOV> liberalisation of the railways

182.3948211669922 both together <OOV> and liberalisation are most important if the railways are to <OOV> in the internal market

265.615478515625 i am delighted that we have <OOV> with the rapporteur and <OOV> other members in finding a good common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that

261.33306884765625 this applies <OOV> all to the <OOV> highly <OOV> derogations from the <OOV> but also to the social dimension of this directive where we were finally able to achieve a compromise

210.6144256591797 nonetheless and we in the group of the european people s party and european <OOV> continue to believe that we are right here <OOV> <OOV> social aspects do not <OOV> in this purely technical directive even if the commission and the council may think otherwise

46.26974105834961 we are <OOV> <OOV> to involving <OOV> in working out <OOV>

226.49998474121094 including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage

181.99368286132812 finally a few other proposed amendments have been tabled which we consider are quite simply too <OOV> and have no positive aspects to <OOV>

327.34808349609375 in short our group is against any elements which are <OOV> when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient european railway as <OOV> <OOV>

247.5613250732422 allow me in <OOV> to <OOV> the excellent cooperation once again i am <OOV> that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as <OOV> a railway system as possible

91.47088623046875  mr president i would first like to congratulate mr <OOV> on his <OOV> of such excellent reports

58.28495788574219 this is an important <OOV> but also an extremely <OOV> one

52.129302978515625 mr <OOV> has taken good account of the <OOV> of others

180.2916259765625 my group <OOV> improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition

314.8580322265625 the first stage is to create the conditions for <OOV> movement of <OOV> over the entire region of the european union

98.36100769042969 technical <OOV> for <OOV> <OOV> and common standards are a <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> for the development of railway <OOV>

137.296142578125 the rapporteur has quite <OOV> adopted a gradual approach

121.7145004272461 technical solutions can vary a great deal

283.393798828125 the competitiveness of railways should not be <OOV> by the <OOV> of additional economic <OOV> even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term

761.380126953125 existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some <OOV> in the harmonisation of railway systems so that no member state shall have to face <OOV> difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be <OOV>

91.56658172607422 this report <OOV> a course of action by which these <OOV> can be accepted without <OOV> the <OOV> objective

127.52072143554688 there is one further matter which would require <OOV> <OOV> this was <OOV> in amendment no by my group

274.3624267578125 it applies to finland in particular but some of the applicant countries will be <OOV> with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the union

178.21176147460938 the matter referred to concerns russian <OOV> <OOV> where technical solutions are applied which <OOV> from those of the member states <OOV> <OOV> in the area of <OOV> and <OOV>

33.22285079956055 they are not <OOV> <OOV> but different

87.09231567382812 russia is <OOV> about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the union

42.92598342895508 for finland this is an <OOV> major issue

342.69732666015625 due to historical reasons the track gauge in finland and russia is the same but it is different from that in europe in general

113.82532501220703 russian <OOV> account for <OOV> almost a half of <OOV> <OOV> transport

163.02835083007812 the reason for this high <OOV> is that we do not want to take the risk of <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> to russia since experience shows that they are so very <OOV> <OOV>

252.62107849121094 russia of course is a country which <OOV> <OOV> on rail transport with a rolling stock which must <OOV> that of the entire region of the eu put

380.9267272949219 in the <OOV> concerning point of article mr <OOV> <OOV> that when considering special cases particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries

180.77401733398438 this proposal is very good but the solution remains half <OOV> as far as finland is concerned

116.55473327636719 it will lead to <OOV> and <OOV> inspections of russian <OOV> and to <OOV> <OOV>

139.3496856689453 there is no <OOV> either that russian <OOV> in all <OOV> would be <OOV> as special cases

445.6798400878906 this is why we have tabled an amendment of article which simply <OOV> at making it possible to use third country <OOV> <OOV> for traffic as long as they do not cross the border between two member states

256.5942687988281 this is the <OOV> referred to as point <OOV> in the committee s amendment implementation of this proposal would give <OOV> that rail traffic in finland could continue without <OOV> <OOV> reduced

138.76248168945312 mr president environment commissioner i am <OOV> that you are here because we can now <OOV> this matter <OOV> away

405.4363708496094 we are <OOV> <OOV> a highly technical subject matter namely the <OOV> of both high speed and conventional rail systems

176.02969360351562 this gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal

346.9780578613281 today we are <OOV> <OOV> one of many <OOV> <OOV> which those who work in the sector as well as those who are in favour of <OOV> have <OOV> for for a long time because at the end of the day all this is of course meant to <OOV> in <OOV> harmonisation which <OOV> the harmonisation of international rail labour organisations train <OOV> who have to make international rail <OOV> etc this also means that <OOV> organisations and trade unions will have an <OOV> different role and <OOV> with respect to this work

182.80947875976562 in short the proposal has a <OOV> on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality

484.4861755371094 certainly if i look at the high speed link and its technical <OOV> i share mr <OOV> s view who has drawn up an excellent report that it is <OOV> that three <OOV> four years after the previous directive on <OOV> of the high speed link we are still waiting for technical <OOV> for <OOV>

48.01363754272461 this does not <OOV> well at all for the future

195.44784545898438 what we are <OOV> for in the long run with this rail proposal is to <OOV> to cut down on traffic <OOV> but also more <OOV> to benefit the environment safety and a number of other aspects

401.4523620605469 it has to be said and i have already mentioned this several times within other <OOV> that the rail system is gradually <OOV> its environmental <OOV> not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself but more so because we ourselves <OOV> few if any <OOV> for example regarding the use of <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> the type of electricity used etc

387.04779052734375 what we would like and this is why we welcome with open <OOV> the <OOV> speed for technical <OOV> requirements is for this technical <OOV> to at least take account of energy consumption and <OOV> <OOV> something which will require a great deal of hard work

212.0994110107422 the second important point is of course the social dimension as i <OOV> upon a moment ago

69.75517272949219 i <OOV> that we are <OOV> ourselves to the <OOV> minimum i e working conditions

371.68621826171875 we refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one <OOV> further because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways

552.8506469726562 i would <OOV> you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes so that we can <OOV> from experiences in countries which have <OOV> in the past and which are often still <OOV> where other elements of the rail <OOV> are concerned such as liberalisation or fair <OOV>

93.78301239013672 mr president despite european integration the rail system is <OOV>

175.6122283935547 it is <OOV> hard to obtain international rail <OOV> and it is often the case that train <OOV> to <OOV> <OOV> have to be <OOV> outside the country of <OOV>

450.6899719238281 not so long ago it was possible to take a direct train from <OOV> to <OOV> from <OOV> to lisbon or from amsterdam to copenhagen

58.61958694458008 this is now a thing of the past

47.02986526489258 <OOV> railways are however in the process of being <OOV> <OOV>

123.74884796142578 the times when <OOV> were seen as a <OOV> <OOV> from the <OOV> century something that can be <OOV> and <OOV> are <OOV> over

205.02633666992188 almost <OOV> <OOV> that <OOV> should once again play a key role in european long <OOV> transport for people and <OOV> alike

177.52822875976562 this is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport <OOV> but <OOV> to <OOV> the <OOV> of cars and <OOV> which form a threat to the environment

45.693031311035156 the <OOV> on how to <OOV> the rail system are <OOV> <OOV>

94.537353515625 for a long time it was <OOV> to apply everything that had <OOV> to the <OOV> of cars and <OOV> to <OOV>

502.3961181640625 according to this line of <OOV> everything should come down in price and should become flexible so that price based competition has a less <OOV> effect on <OOV>

280.79693603515625 some people still <OOV> that everything should be <OOV> and <OOV> that the <OOV> of trade unions must be <OOV> and that railway personnel should <OOV> more work for lower <OOV>

220.776611328125 according to the <OOV> group of the european united left <OOV> green left these <OOV> are <OOV> than the <OOV>

254.0712432861328 these would <OOV> lead to further <OOV> of the railway business and <OOV> in the quality of services and would force personnel to <OOV> more for reasons of self <OOV>

983.1111450195312 the real solutions must be <OOV> in a completely different <OOV> for <OOV> there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of <OOV> and fast cross border routes

241.977294921875 in the case of the conventional railway system the routes <OOV> to amsterdam <OOV> to copenhagen and <OOV> to <OOV> are good <OOV> of this

155.48065185546875 the <OOV> are <OOV> that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and <OOV> link

134.22860717773438 this could also apply to the <OOV> of the french high speed <OOV> in <OOV> <OOV> the <OOV> and germany which are running under the <OOV> <OOV> and <OOV>

314.58795166015625 to guarantee success it is important not to bring in a whole <OOV> of new <OOV> businesses which would lead to bad <OOV> and <OOV> <OOV>

694.353759765625 furthermore the money to <OOV> such a high speed network should not be found through <OOV> down services on short <OOV> routes in the individual member states as many people are <OOV> and <OOV> so about the huge amount of funding being <OOV> into fast <OOV> for the benefit of a small <OOV> <OOV>

523.5079956054688 the <OOV> of new high speed <OOV> will continue to meet with <OOV> if the <OOV> <OOV> train <OOV> only <OOV> experiences <OOV> prices and <OOV> <OOV> and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and <OOV>

311.21044921875 <OOV> to say technology should be better <OOV> by means of common <OOV> <OOV> joint equipment <OOV> changes for <OOV> at <OOV> and <OOV> safety requirements

271.17144775390625 <OOV> and <OOV> according to the <OOV> model offer no guarantee <OOV> that those <OOV> could be better <OOV> than if we were to keep the present state <OOV>

104.53329467773438 the position of the one million employees in the european rail system must be <OOV>

Average perplexity = 272.7745666503906
